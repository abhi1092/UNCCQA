These widespread domains (e.g. WD40 or TPR) are present in a multitude of combinations in many eukaryotic proteins [10] and can confound gene-fusion detection by appearing to be multiple conserved examples of gene-fusion components [3]. For this reason, we have improved our detection method to filter highly promiscuous domains from predictions.Previously, we used sequence homology and clustering to attempt resolving this issue, however this approach is computationally intensive. For this analysis, we take a simpler approach based on the PFAM domain database [11]. By delineating the domain architecture of each protein involved in a fusion event, we are able to locate and filter those domains that appear to link an inordinate number of proteins together based on domain interaction graph connectivity analysis"

Two proteins will be considered as interacting partners of a gene fusion event if both were similar to a non-overlapping part of a third sequence and were not similar to each other. To check similarity between the interacting proteins, we used a Smith-Waterman dynamic programming alignment tool [30,31] (prss33) with a threshold p-value of 0.04.Promiscuous Domain FilteringWe calculated the domain architecture of all protein sequences using HMMER [32] against the PFAM (v15) database [11] as a reference, using an e-value threshold of E \u2264 1e-10. A frequency analysis was then performed on the connectivity of PFAM domains. Recently, an analysis similar in spirit but different in detail has also been published [33]. The distribution obtained is logarithmic, with a long tail. We assume that this tail indicates the presence of promiscuous domains. When these data are visualized as a network, using the BioLayout tool [34], most of the nodes (i.e. proteins) are connected (i.e. interacting) in a super-cluster, due to the presence of promiscuous domains. We use this domain connectivity graph in order to determine a threshold for the removal of promiscuous domains"

Consistent with these findings, HRC(S96A) reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC(WT). Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks, which was reduced by HRC(WT), was increased by mutant HRC(S96A) under resting conditions although there were no spontaneous Ca(2+) waves under stress conditions. However, expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic Ca(2+) transients. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers."

Furthermore, CMTs also play a role in de novo methylation (Cao et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2005). CMT is characterized by a chromatin-associated domain (chromodomain) embedded within the catalytic motifs I and IV of the protein (Henikoff and Comai, 1998). The presence of this plant-specific methyltransferase provides an explanation for the high levels of CHG methylation in plant genomes relative to animals. In Arabidopsis, the targeting of AtCMT3 methylation is accomplished by short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways (Zilberman et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2004, 2006) and histone methylation H3K9, H3K27 (Jackson et al., 2002; Lindroth, 2004)."

Subsequent analysis of CMT3 mutants points to a key role in egg cell reprogramming by controlling silencing in both transposon and euchromatic regions. A speculative model of the CMT3-induced egg cell silencing is presented here, based on these results and current data from the literature suggesting the potential involvement of small RNAs targeted to the egg cell, a process conceptually similar to the division of labor described in the male gametophyte for which we show that H3K9 modifications and TFL2 localization are reminiscent of the female gametophyte."

In rare cases, autoimmune IIT also manifests as Graves' disease, which is defined by antithyroid antibodies with hyperthyroidism. Non-autoimmune IIT presents as destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism.6Hashimoto's thyroiditis is diagnosed in up to 40% of patients, and hypothyroidism can be triggered by IFN\u03b1.7 Hypothyroidism frequently escapes diagnosis due to the overlap of its symptoms with those induced by IFN\u03b1 itself, such as fatigue, somnolence and depression."
