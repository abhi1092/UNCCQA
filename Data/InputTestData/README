where:
- phaseId corresponds either to A or B, for phase A or phase B of task B respectively.
- ChallengeEditionId corresponds to 1, 2 or 3, for the first, the second or the third edition of the challenge respectively.
- testId corresponds to 1,..,5 denoting the test set. 
For example, phaseA_2b_05.json is the 5th test set of the second year of phase A test dataset.
