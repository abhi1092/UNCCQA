      "ideal_answer": "Low-grade gliomas were accurately classified into four groups: group 1, IDH+/p53-/1p19q-; group 2, IDH+/p53-/1p19q+; group 3, IDH+/p53+/1p19q-; and group 4, triple negative gliomas. According to IDH, TP53, and 1p19q status, four major subtypes of LGG are recorded: IDH+/p53-/1p19q-, IDH+/p53+/1p19q-, IDH+/p53-/1p19q+ and triple negative, this last subgroup having the worst prognosis. Among 615 grade II or III gliomas, 29% had all three alterations (i.e., were triple-positive), 5% had TERT and IDH mutations, 45% had only IDH mutations, 7% were triple-negative, and 10% had only TERT mutations; 5% had other combinations. Among 472 grade IV gliomas, less than 1% were triple-positive, 2% had TERT and IDH mutations, 7% had only IDH mutations, 17% were triple-negative, and 74% had only TERT mutations. Three of these markers - 1p/19q deletions, MGMT methylation status, and mutations in the IDH1 gene - are so potent that a new brain tumor subtype, the \"triple negative\" glioma (1p/19q intact, MGMT unmethylated, IDH1 non-mutated) has entered common parlance.

      "ideal_answer": "Ctf4 Links DNA Replication with Sister Chromatid Cohesion Establishment by Recruiting the Chl1 Helicase to the Replisome. The Eco1 acetyltransferase, helped by factors including Ctf4 and Chl1, concomitantly acetylates the chromosomal cohesin complex to stabilize its cohesive links. Here we show that Ctf4 recruits the Chl1 helicase to the replisome via a conserved interaction motif that Chl1 shares with GINS and polymerase α. The Chl1 helicase facilitates replication fork progression under conditions of nucleotide depletion, partly independently of Ctf4 interaction. Conversely, Ctf4 interaction, but not helicase activity, is required for Chl1\u0027s role in sister chromatid cohesion. A physical interaction between Chl1 and the cohesin complex during S phase suggests that Chl1 contacts cohesin to facilitate its acetylation. Our results reveal how Ctf4 forms a replisomal interaction hub that coordinates replication fork progression and sister chromatid cohesion establishment. "

      "ideal_answer": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency) is the most common red blood cell (RBC) enzyme disorder. The decrease as well as the absence of the enzyme increase RBC vulnerability to oxidative stress caused by exposure to certain medications or intake of fava beans. In the most frequent variants of this disease hemolysis occurs only during stress, imposed for example by infection, \"oxidative\" drugs or after ingestion of fava beans. Among the most common clinical manifestations of this condition, acute hemolysis, chronic hemolysis, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and an asymptomatic form are observed. Red blood cells carry oxygen in the body and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase protects these cells from oxidative chemicals. If there is a lack of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, red blood cells can go acute hemolysis. Convulsion is a rare presentation for acute hemolysis due to Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency. Some enzyme variants can cause chronic hemolysis which is described as chronic nonsperocytic hemolytic anemia. The most serious clinical complication of the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency is the rarely observed neonatal icterus. By far the most common form worldwide is the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency. "

This concept has been further supported by the identification of the most common genetic cause for both diseases, an aberrantly expanded hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC/ CCCCGG sequence located in a non-coding region of the gene C9orf72. Over the years, however, growing evidence from clinical, pathological and genetic findings has suggested that ALS and FTD belong to the same clinic-pathological spectrum disorder. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neurone loss resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity and ultimately death. "

An IL-4R antagonist, dupilumab, is the first drug that shows great promise in phase II trials. This study reviewed all studies about any roles of IL-4 that can directly and indirectly be played in the development of pemphigus and IL-4 inhibition with interferons and dupilumab therapy were introduced as a novel pemphigus treatment for patients who are in relapse phase of the disease. Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation. "

It has been reported recently that about 80% of DIPG cases and 70% of midline glioblastomas contain a mutation at one allele of the H3F3A gene (encoding histone H3 variant H3.3), replacing the lysine 27 with methionine (K27M). Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. we were able to discern the H3F3A K27M mutation in a newly obtained pediatric brainstem glioblastoma sample whose H3.3 status was not known previously, and in three other DIPG samples as well as paraffin embedded samples. Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1). Two new studies show that the known histone H3 alteration p.Lys27Met in pediatric glioma leads to globally diminished trimethylation at histone H3 lysine 27. "

      "ideal_answer": "Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by diffuse or localized dilation and eventual rupture of the enteric lymphatic vessels in mucosa, submucosa, and/or subserosa. Lymph, rich in all kinds of proteins and lymphocytes, leaks into the gastrointestinal tract via the affected lymphatic vessels causing hypoproteinemia and lymphopenia. Diagnosis depends largely on its pathologic condition demonstrating greatly dilated lymphatics mainly in the lamina propria of the mucosa. The histopathologic condition of the resected small intestine showed lymphatic dilation limited mainly to the subserosa and mesentery but was not prominent in the mucosa. PIL, effusions, and lymphedema can be the features of multisegmental generalized lymphatic dysplasia. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is one mechanism leading to PLE. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is a rare cause of protein-losing enteropathy and usually presents with intermittent diarrhea or malnutrition. A number of disorders have been described to cause protein losing enteropathy (PLE) in children. "

We found conservation of heterozygous K27M mutations in H3F3A (n \u003d 4) or HIST1H3B (n \u003d 3) across all primary, contiguous, and metastatic tumor sites in all DIPGs. TP53 aberrations (n \u003d 3 patients) varied by type and location between primary and metastatic tumors sites but were intra-tumorally conserved. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (TP53/PPM1D) or specific growth factor pathways (ACVR1/PIK3R1). ACVR1 (n \u003d 2), PIK3CA (n \u003d 2), FGFR1 (n \u003d 2), and MET (n \u003d 1) were also intra-tumorally conserved. "

      "ideal_answer": "Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development. Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development. Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. "

Oral PUVA is preferable for patients with hyperkeratotic eczema and bath PUVA for patients with dyshidrotic eczema. Local narrowband UVB phototherapy regimen is as effective as paint-PUVA therapy in patients with chronic hand eczema of dry and dyshidrotic types. Both oral and bath PUVA with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic palmoplantar eczema. Oral vs. bath PUVA using 8-methoxypsoralen for chronic palmoplantar eczema. UVB and PUVA (psoralen plus UVA) therapy is effective and has relatively few side effects. Although local PUVA has been proven to be effective in the treatment of chronic hand eczema, little is known about the efficacy and safety of local narrowband UVB (TL-01) for this condition. If topical treatment fails, the best second-line option is ultraviolet (UV) therapy alone or as combination therapy. Treatment of hand eczema is dominated by the administration of topical glucocorticosteriods. "

Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia.

      "ideal_answer": "INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are increasingly being used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but consideration of benefits and potential adverse events is required. Three of those studies also established superiority with liraglutide, empagliflozin, and semaglutide at reducing the composite primary endpoint of major CV events (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke). Two studies of GLP-1 receptor agonists-one of liraglutide and one of semaglutide-have shown cardiovascular benefit relative to placebo, and one study of the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin has shown benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: In response to guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration, thousands of patients have been enrolled in large randomized trials evaluating the cardiovascular effects of the three newest diabetes drug classes: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Seven trials have been published that have established CV safety for three DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, and sitagliptin), three GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide), and one sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). New antidiabetic drugs are being developed today that expand the range of pharmacological intervention, in particular for patients with type 2 diabetes (imeglimin, semaglutide, dulaglutide, FGF 21 analogue).

Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6. Gene loops have been described in different organisms from yeast to human and form through interaction between components of the transcription pre-initiation complex and Ssu72, a member of the 3\u0027 end cleavage and polyadenylation complex. Screening crude natural product extracts with this technology has resulted in the identification of a novel family of antifungal natural products, named the parnafungins, which inhibit the enzyme polyadenosine polymerase (PAP), a key component of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex. We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3\u0027 cleavage and polyadenylation comple. "

The key feature of DECKO is its use of a single 165 bp starting oligonucleotide carrying the variable sequences of both gRNAs, making it fully scalable from single-locus studies to complex library cloning. We present a vector system adapted for this purpose called DECKO (Double Excision CRISPR Knockout), which applies a simple two-step cloning to generate lentiviral vectors expressing two guide RNAs (gRNAs) simultaneously.

After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology, X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn. The genetic pattern is consistent with x-linked recessive inheritance and the defect is associated with drug (primaquine) induced haemolysis. Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency. The investigation of the patient\u0027s whole family showed the typical recessive X-linked inheritance of this enzyme-defect.

Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. These results demonstrated that in a cohort of subjects with severe primary hypobetalipoproteinemia the prevalence of ANGPTL3 gene mutations responsible for a combined hypolipidemia phenotype is about 10%, whereas mutations of APOB gene are absent. Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum. Mutations of the ANGPTL3 gene have been associated with a novel form of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia, the combined hypolipidemia (cHLP), characterized by low total cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol levels. Mutations in the genes APOB, and ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 (that encode angiopoietin-like proteins which inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity) can further cause low levels of apoB containing lipoproteins. "

Methods In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease. The combination of antiestrogen therapy and ribociclib, an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor, led to improved outcomes in women with metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, according to findings presented at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for their future clinical development. This study assessed the biological activity of ribociclib (LEE011; CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus letrozole compared with single-agent letrozole in the presurgical setting. After noting an inverse correlation with sensitivity to ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), we studied the combinatorial effect of these two agents using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, Ki67 immunostaining, timelapse microscopy and xenograft studies.

Mis18α deficiency led to reduced DNA methylation, altered histone modifications, and uncontrolled noncoding transcripts in centromere region by decreased DNMT3A/3B enrichment. Mis16 and Mis18 form a complex and maintain the deacetylated state of histones specifically in the central core of centromeres. The Mis18 complex has been identified as a critical factor for the centromeric localization of a histone H3 variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A), which is responsible for the specification of centromere identity in the chromosome. Further, we demonstrate Mis18α\u0027s crucial role for epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin by reinforcing centromeric localization of DNMT3A/3B. Here, we generated Mis18α conditional knockout mice and found that Mis18α deficiency resulted in lethality at early embryonic stage with severe defects in chromosome segregation caused by mislocalization of CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, and, in particular, its member M18BP1 was shown to be essential for both incorporation and maintenance of CENP-A. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. Roles of Mis18α in epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin and CENP-A loading. "

Several humanized monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin, including romosozumab and blosozumab, are now in clinical development. Romosozumab, an antibody raised against sclerostin, is a promising bone anabolic agent. Newer anabolic agents are imminent and include an analogue of parathyroid hormone-related protein, abaloparatide, and a humanised monoclonal antibody to an inhibitor of bone formation, romosozumab. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Phase I and II studies of the two humanized sclerostin monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab and blosozumab, both of which have had positive effects on bone mineral density. Romosozumab inhibits sclerostin, thereby increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption.

The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3\u0027-end processing. We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and terminator regions are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation. The first 300 amino acids of Pta1 are sufficient for interactions with Ssu72, which is needed for pre-mRNA cleavage. Furthermore, different regions of Pta1 interact with the CPF subunits Ssu72, Pti1, and Ysh1, supporting the idea that Pta1 acts as a scaffold to organize CPF. These interactions are transcription-dependent, require the Ssu72 and Pta1 components of the CPF 3\u0027-end processing complex, and require the phosphatase activity of Ssu72. "

These artificial short peptides are able to specifically bind, track, and inhibit a given target molecule with high affinity, even molecules with poor immunogenicity or high toxicity, and represent a remarkable alternative to antibodies in many different applications. To inhibit the oncogenic action of Stat3 in tumor cells, we have selected short peptides, so-called peptide aptamers, which specifically interact with defined functional domains of this transcription factor. Our study clearly demonstrates the ability of MD simulations to obtain molecular insights for peptide-aptamer binding, and to provide details on the orientation and location of binding between the peptide-aptamer that can be instrumental in biosensor development. Understanding orientation and location of the binding region for a peptide-aptamer complex is critical in their biosensor applicability. Within the biosensor the aptamers are immobilized to maximize their access to target molecules. Knowledge of the orientation and location of the aptamer and peptide during binding could be gained through computational modeling. Aptamers are highly efficient, have a high specificity and are reusable. Aptasensors utilize aptamers as bioreceptors. "

The human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail ZMapp, previously shown to be efficacious in EBOV (variant Kikwit) lethally infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administration was initiated up to 5 days, was used in some patients during the outbreak. We show that a two-antibody cocktail, MIL77E, is fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV variant Makona, the virus responsible for the ongoing 2014-2015 outbreak, whereas a similar formulation of ZMapp protected two of three NHPs. This includes agents belonging to various therapeutic classes, namely direct antiviral agents (favipiravir and BCX4430), a combination of antibodies (ZMapp), type I interferons, RNA interference-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and anticoagulant drugs (rNAPc2). Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics.

Most hydrogen peroxide-induced histone H2AX phosphorylation is mediated by ATR and is not dependent on DNA double-strand breaks. These results suggest that a major fraction of γH2AX induced by oxidative stress is not associated with DSBs. A sequence variant of histone H2A called H2AX is one of the key components of chromatin involved in DNA damage response induced by different genotoxic stresses. Here, we examine γH2AX and repair protein foci along linear ion tracks traversing heterochromatic regions in human or murine cells and find the DSBs and damage signal streaks bending around highly compacted DNA. Single-stranded DNA arisen from stalled replication forks can cause the ATR-mediated induction of γH2AX. he cellular response to DSBs depends on damage signaling including the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX (γH2AX). Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) is rapidly concentrated in chromatin domains around DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) after the action of ionizing radiation or chemical agents and at stalled replication forks during replication stress. Histone H2AX phosphorylation as a measure of DNA double-strand breaks and a marker of environmental stress and disease activity in lupus. "

These data are proof of principle that by performing affinity selection on neutralizing antibodies, our VLP technology can identify peptide mimics of non-linear epitopes and that these mimotope based VLP vaccines provide protection against pathogens in relevant animal models. An artificial gene, designated 5epis (5 epitopes) and consisting of the five mimotopes arranged in tandem (F1-F7-B34-2B1-2G8) with four GGGS spacers, was chemically synthesized and cloned into a prokaryotic expression plasmid pET28b.

Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva(TM)) is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist that is being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various liver diseases, and has recently been granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid. A series of clinical trials of OCA in PBC, primarily in combination with UDCA, have established that OCA leads to significant reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase that are predicted to lead to improved clinical outcomes, while dose-dependent pruritus has been the most common adverse effect. While several agents are being studied in combination with UDCA, monotherapy with the novel agent obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, has also shown promising results. "

Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene.

Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment.

The term isolated ectopia lentis (EL; subluxation or dislocation of the human crystalline lens) is applied to patients with EL, without skeletal features and in the absence of aortic root dilatation. Here we report a novel founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 gene in children of Bukharian Jewish origin presenting with early-onset bilateral EL. In conclusion, we report on a case of early-onset autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis caused by FBN1 mutation that has previously been reported only in Marfan syndrome. A founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes early-onset bilateral ectopia lentis among Jews of Bukharian origin. To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. A novel mutation of FBN1 results in an arginine to cysteine residue (p.R974C) substitution, which is responsible for the patients with isolated EL in this Chinese family. Early onset ectopia lentis due to a FBN1 mutation with non-penetrance. "

CONCLUSIONS: GAMES-RP was designed to provide critical information regarding glyburide for injection in patients with large hemispheric stroke and will inform the design of future studies. RESULTS: We report that IV glyburide was associated with T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity ratio on brain MRI, diminished the lesional water diffusivity between days 1 and 2 (pseudo-normalization), and reduced blood MMP-9 level.CONCLUSIONS: Several surrogate markers of vasogenic edema appear to be reduced in the setting of IV glyburide treatment in human stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preclinical and retrospective clinical data indicate that glyburide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4, is effective in preventing edema and improving outcome after focal ischemia. Glyburide is reported to prevent brain swelling in preclinical rodent models of ischemic stroke through inhibition of a non-selective channel composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4.

Results indicated that miR-138 directly targeted SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and overexpression of SOX4 and HIF-1α effectively reversed the miR-138-mediated suppression of cell invasion.

INTERPRETATION: Vemurafenib showed antitumour activity in patients with progressive, BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine who had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor. Initial reports in patients with progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory BRAF-mutant papillary thyroid cancer suggest response rates of approximately 30-40%. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have demonstrated superior efficacy in patients with BRAF-mutant melanomas but have limited efficacy in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Efficacy and tolerability of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E) -positive papillary thyroid cancer: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center off label experience. CONTEXT: Vemurafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, appears to have promising clinical activity in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in patients with advanced PTC harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial.

Barth syndrome, an X-linked disorder that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and growth delay, is caused by mutations in the taffazin gene at Xq28 that result in cardiolipin deficiency and abnormal mitochondria. Barth syndrome should be considered when boys present with cardiomyopathy, especially when associated with increased left ventricular trabeculations, neutropenia, skeletal muscle weakness, or family history indicating an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the G4.5 gene result in a wide spectrum of severe infantile X-linked cardiomyopathic phenotypes including Barth syndrome with dilated cardiomyopathy and INVM. X-linked mode of inheritance is seen in Menkes disease, Barth syndrome, and in deficiencies of the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked recessive disease primarily affecting males. "

Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a growing group of inherited metabolic disorders where enzymatic defects in the formation or processing of glycolipids and/or glycoproteins lead to variety of different diseases. In humans, proteins are modified with a diverse range of glycoforms synthesized in complex biosynthetic pathways. A hallmark in a subset of CDG cases is the reduced glycosylation site occupancy of asparagine-linked glycans. As glycosylation affects proteins all over the organism, a mutation in a single gene leads to a multisystemic disorder. Congenital disorders of glycosylation form a rapidly growing group of inherited metabolic diseases. Glycosylation is an integral part in health and disease, as emphasized by the growing number of identified glycosylation defects. More than 100 rare human genetic disorders that result from deficiencies in the different glycosylation pathways are known today. Glycosylation disorders have been described in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) as well as in acquired disease conditions such and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). "

We present EP-DNN, a protocol for predicting enhancers based on chromatin features, in different cell types. DEEP: a general computational framework for predicting enhancers. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer\u0027s properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. "

      "ideal_answer": "A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane. Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols. "

Together, these data establish the importance of SKA2 for cortisol stress responsivity and the development of PTSD and provide further evidence that SKA2 is a promising biomarker for stress-related disorders including PTSD. Results provide novel support for PTSD-related accelerated aging in DNAm and extend the evidence base of known DNAm age correlates to the domains of neural integrity and cognition. Permutation analysis using random methylation loci supported these findings. with an optimal sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.91. 95% CI: 0.53-0.79). "

      "ideal_answer": "Patients treated with dupilumab had marked and rapid improvement in all the evaluated measures of atopic dermatitis disease activity. The robust effects of dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2 cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with asthma and atopic dermatitis, which are both type 2 helper T-cell-mediated diseases. Dupilumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that was recently studied in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilumab is a biologic agent targeted at TH2 cytokines, but indirectly impacts IgE and is an important biologic agent for atopic disease.

      "ideal_answer": "Mal de debarquement (MdD) is a subjective perception of self-motion after exposure to passive motion, in most cases sea travel, hence the name. Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a rare and poorly understood condition of perceived continual motion. BACKGROUND: Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a disorder of chronic self-motion perception that occurs though entrainment to rhythmic background motion, such as from sea voyage, and involves the perception of low-frequency rocking that can last for months or years. Mal de debarquement occurs quite frequently in otherwise healthy individuals for a short period of time (several hours). OBJECTIVE: Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a balance disorder that typically starts after an extended exposure to passive motion, such as a boat or plane ride. It is characterized by abnormal sensation of motion/balance reported after travel by air, land, and sea; being reexposed to motion/activity relieves it. However, in some people symptoms remain for a longer period of time or even persist and this is then called mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS). Symptoms may last from minutes to years. "

We present CisMapper, which predicts the regulatory targets of a TF using the correlation between a histone mark at the TF\u0027s bound sites and the expression of each gene across a panel of tissues. Using both chromatin conformation capture and differential expression data, we show that CisMapper is more accurate at predicting the target genes of a TF than the distance-based approaches currently used, and is particularly advantageous for predicting the long-range regulatory interactions typical of tissue-specific gene expression. Unlike distance-based methods, CisMapper can predict which transcription start site of a gene is regulated by a particular binding site of the TF. CisMapper also predicts which TF binding sites regulate a given gene more accurately than using genomic distance. "

Among full autosomal trisomies, only trisomies of chromosome 21 (Down syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 13 (Patau syndrome) are compatible with postnatal survival. Mosaic trisomy 13 is very rare, it occurs in only 5% of all patients with trisomy 13 phenotype. Two cases were triploid. Patau syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Down syndrome were found in two cases each. We describe the management of the eyelid anomaly associated with Patau syndrome. This article identifies the causes and manifestations of most of these trisomies: trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Trisomy 13 is the genotype of the syndrome\u0027s phenotype. "
