Adult men and women, youth and children ≥6 years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study. Methods: MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Previous studies have shown that the Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat. Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. Objective To ascertain the appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria and to identify factors related to antibiotic dispensing.

      "ideal_answer": "Mammalian CLOCK and BMAL1 are two members of bHLH-PAS-containing family of transcription factors that represent the positive elements of circadian autoregulatory feedback loop. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG). Formation of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex following ectopic coexpression of both proteins is followed by their codependent phosphorylation, which is tightly coupled to CLOCK nuclear translocation and degradation. Altogether, these results provide evidence for an additional level of circadian system control, which is based on regulation of transcriptional activity or/and availability of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex. We have examined abundance, posttranslational modifications, cellular localization of endogenous and ectopically expressed CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins. Nuclear/cytoplasm distribution of CLOCK was found to be under circadian regulation. "

      "ideal_answer": "General regulatory factors (GRFs) as genome partitioners. GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains. This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and stress-dependent transcriptional modulation. We speculate that an important function of general regulatory factors such as Reb1p is to establish and maintain proper transcription start sites at promoters, and that when binding of such factors is compromised, resulting effects on mRNA translation may be an underappreciated aspect of gene regulation studies. Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast. "

Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11). Single‑nucleotide polymorphism‑array analysis of the proband indicated a partial duplication of chromosomes 22 and 11 at 22q11.1‑q11.21.

Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays. Here, we systematically dissect auxin sensing by SCFTIR1-IAA6 and SCFTIR1-IAA19 co-receptor complexes, and assess IAA6/IAA19 ubiquitylation in vitro and IAA6/IAA19 degradation in vivo. Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking. "

Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of \"apple body type\" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CONCLUSION: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable. Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. BACKGROUND: An accurate, clinical screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that identifies patients for further diagnostic testing would assist in the diagnosis of this comorbidity. "

Based on the clival location and histologic findings along with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and positivity for nuclear brachyury staining, the final pathologic diagnosis for both cases was PD chordoma. All 8 cases were positive for brachyury, whereas there was no nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases, including the poorly differentiated chordoma. Identification of loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in poorly differentiated (PD) chordoma in pediatric patients suggests that PD chordoma is an entity molecularly distinct from conventional chordoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, which is also characterized by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by inactivating mutation of the SMARCB1/INI gene.

In addition, an intervening STAR uncouples the silencing of neighboring genes. Subtelomeres also contain Sub-Telomeric Anti-silencing Regions (STARs). These elements were named STARs, for subtelomeric anti-silencing regions. STARs can also counteract silencer-driven repression at the mating-type HML locus. STARs thus display the hallmarks of insulators. "

Circ-ZNF609 is associated with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes. They are known to serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and encode for proteins. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for translation of circRNAs, revealing the existence of an unexplored layer of gene activity.

We show that most of this preferential association is not due to vegetative (also known as somatic) pairing but is caused by the polar orientation of interphase chromosomes (Rabl orientation). Within this general arrangement homologous telocentric chromosomes were frequently seen to have their centromeres associated or directed towards each other. In large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear membrane. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. Centromere clustering is a major determinant of yeast interphase nuclear organization. telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation.

We aimed to evaluate seasonality and temporal trends in IM.METHODS: Data from all Monospot tests, used as a marker for IM, were collected from the Grampian population over 16 years.RESULTS: Positive Monospot test results peaked at 17 years in females and 19 in males. Heterophile antibody tests, including the Monospot test, are red cell or latex agglutination assays, which detect antired cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection.

Strategies that use ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest, such as heat-inducible degron (td) and auxin-inducible degron (AID), are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants. Auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology allows rapid depletion of proteins in animal cells and fungi, but its application to human cells has been limited by the difficulties of tagging endogenous proteins. Other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the SCF degradation pathway, allowing us to transplant the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system into nonplant cells and use a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability. Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast. We show that an auxin concentration of 0.25 mM is necessary for fast and uniform protein depletion between single cells, and that in mother cells proteins are depleted faster than their daughters. "

Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the \u0027CpG island methylator phenotype\u0027 (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis. Supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death. "

In addition to its role as a template-encoding telomeric DNA synthesis, telomerase RNA has been shown to function as a flexible scaffold for protein subunits of the RNP holoenzyme. Like human and budding yeast, fission yeast harbours a population of telomeric RNA molecules containing G-rich telomeric repeats transcribed from the subtelomere to the telomere.

Polycomb group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centered networks. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared with inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Integrating epigenomic data and 3D genomic structure with a new measure of chromatin assortativity. We find that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature and that this signature confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs.

Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops.

YY1-mediated interactions between NPC regulatory elements are often nested within constitutive loops anchored by CTCF. Moreover, siRNA knockdown ofYy1specifically disrupts interactions between key NPC enhancers and their target genes. CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (\u003e90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs \"facing\" one another. Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated. As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. Conversely, CTCF binding sites in NPCs are largely preexisting in pluripotent stem cells. Only a small number of CTCF sites arise de novo in NPCs. "

HPG Pore can run on both individual computers and in the Hadoop distributed computing framework, which allows easy scale-up to manage the large amounts of data expected to result from extensive use of nanopore technologies in the future. The use of nanopore technologies is expected to spread in the future because they are portable and can sequence long fragments of DNA molecules without prior amplification. Despite the flood of data expected from this technology, the data analysis solutions currently available are only designed to manage small projects and are not scalable.RESULTS:. The first nanopore sequencer available, the MinION™ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, is a USB-connected, portable device that allows real-time DNA analysis. In addition, other new instruments are expected to be released soon, which promise to outperform the current short-read technologies in terms of throughput. Here we present HPG Pore, a toolkit for exploring and analysing nanopore sequencing data. "

      "ideal_answer": "An expert panel recommended approval of Novartis\u0027s experimental chimeric antigen T-cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel, for children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel, received FDA approval for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia who haven\u0027t responded to standard therapy or who have relapsed at least twice. Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) is an investigational immunotherapy that involves reprogramming a patient\u0027s own T cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing cells. Most impressively, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART19) have led to impressive responses in patients with B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Indeed, on August 30, 2017, the University of Pennsylvania-designed CD19-directed CART (CART-19) cell therapy (CTL019, tisagenlecleucel-t, Kymriah - Novartis) became the first CART therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CTL019, or KYMRIAH™ (tisagenlecleucel), a CD19 CAR T cell product developed by Novartis and the University of Pennsylvania, was recently approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration, representing a landmark in the application of adoptive T cell therapies.

      "ideal_answer": "\"Morgellons disease\" has been a controversial topic in the history of psychodermatology. Although MD was initially considered to be a delusional disorder, recent studies have demonstrated that the dermopathy is associated with tickborne infection, that the filaments are composed of keratin and collagen, and that they result from proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in epithelial tissue. In contrast, recent studies indicate that MD is a true somatic illness associated with tickborne infection, that the filaments are keratin and collagen in composition and that they result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the skin. Morgellons disease (MD) is a complex skin disorder characterized by ulcerating lesions that have protruding or embedded filaments. Morgellons disease (MD) is a dermopathy characterized by multicolored filaments that lie under, are embedded in, or project from skin. Many clinicians refer to this condition as delusional parasitosis or delusional infestation and consider the filaments to be introduced textile fibers. Some authors have suggested that it may correspond to a common dermatosis with secondary psychopathology. In recent years, there has been a reported increase in affliction of the skin with small fibres or other particles. "
