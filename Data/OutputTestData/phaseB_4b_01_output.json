      "ideal_answer": "The hypocholesterolemic effect of tomato juice has been investigated in an intervention study with rats, along with the possible inhibition effect of bioactive tomato compounds binding to the HMGCR enzyme. The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Women consuming ≥10 compared with\u003c1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L; P \u003d 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P \u003d 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P\u003c0.001) in multivariable models. In conclusion, women consuming ≥10 compared with\u003c1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had clinically modest but significant improvements in TC, the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio, and hemoglobin A1c but not other coronary biomarkers. Considering clinical cutpoints, women consuming ≥10 compared with\u003c1.5 servings/wk were 31% (95% CI \u003d 6%, 50%), 40% (95% CI \u003d 13%, 59%), and 66% (95% CI \u003d 20%, 86%) less likely to have elevated TC (≥6.21 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (≥4.14 mmol/L), and hemoglobin A1c (≥6%), respectively.

      "ideal_answer": "Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers. However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury. Recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3. Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancer. Such permissive binding was largely restricted to open-chromatin regions showing histone modification marks characteristic of active enhancer and promoter regions, whereas open-chromatin regions lacking such marks did not show permissive binding. We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury.

      "ideal_answer": "Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity. In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.

Several proteins that stimulate mRNA decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex co-localize with Dcp1 and Dcp2, together with Xrn1, a 5\u0027-to-3\u0027 exonuclease, to structures in the cytoplasm called processing bodies. n eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5\u0027 to 3\u0027 direction requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5\u0027 to 3\u0027 exonuclease XRN1. PBs are associated with mRNA decay and contain the decapping enzymes DCP1/2, the 5\u0027 to 3\u0027 exonuclease Xrn1, the Lsm proteins (1-7), and the scaffolding proteins hedls/GE-1 and GW182. Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and various regulators of mRNA stability and translation (TTP, RCK/p54, and CPEB). These enzymes are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies (because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen). "

Sorafenib and lenvatinib, small-molecule multikinase inhibitors, were approved for the treatment of progressive, symptomatic, radioactive iodine refractory, advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in 2013 and 2015, respectively. A phase 2 trial of lenvatinib (E7080) in advanced, progressive, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer: A clinical outcomes and biomarker assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with and without prior exposure to VEGF therapy, the encouraging response rates, median time to response, and PFS for lenvatinib have prompted further investigation in a phase 3 trial. However, even more impressive responses and progression-free survival benefits were seen in the phase III SELECT trial with lenvatinib, giving even higher hopes for the future management of what was considered just a decade ago an orphan disease. Moreover, four of those investigational drugs, vandetanib, cabozantinib, sorafenib and lenvatinib, have reached a phase III clinical trial with favorable results in progression-free survival and overall survival in medullary thyroid carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

      "ideal_answer": "This is accompanied by reductions in the level of H3K36 trimethylation, a posttranslational histone modification associated with efficient transcriptional elongation, and the number of full-length transcripts from these genes. Overall, our results show and suggest that multiple H4, H2A, and H3 residues contribute to and form a Set2 docking/recognition site on the nucleosomal surface so that proper Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation, histone acetylation, and transcriptional elongation can occur. Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3\u0027 ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription.

Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus. We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin. In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. "

In the present article, the enzymatic properties and the involvement of sPLA(2) and Lp-PLA(2) in atherogenesis are reviewed, with a focus on the results of experimental studies and clinical studies with both varespladib and darapladib inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: Several secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), including group IIA, III, V, and X, have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which led to the clinical testing of A-002 (varespladib), a broad sPLA2 inhibitor for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The potential pro-atherogenic role of PLA(2) led to the development of two small molecules, varespladib, a reversible sPLA(2) inhibitor, and darapladib, a selective Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor. Large-scale Phase III trials are now underway with agents that lead to marked reductions in IL-6 and C-reactive protein (such as canakinumab and methotrexate) as well as with agents that impact on diverse non-IL-6-dependent pathways (such as varespladib and darapladib).

The impact of age (≤ 70 vs.\u003e70 years), sex, tumor diameter (\u003c6 vs. ≥ 6 cm), pre- and postoperative KPS (\u003c80 vs. ≥ 80), Simpson grade (I-II vs. III-IV), and World Health Organization (WHO) histologic grade (I vs. II-III) on survival was assessed. Simpson Grade I-III Resection of Spinal Atypical (World Health Organization Grade II) Meningiomas is Associated With Symptom Resolution and Low Recurrence. After Simpson grade I-III or gross total resection, no tumors recurred (0%; confidence interval, 0%-17.6%). After Simpson grade IV resection, 1 tumor recurred (50%; confidence interval, 1.3%-98.7%).

CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. Ipilimumab (CTLA-4) and pembrolizumab (PD-1) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma, and additional regulatory approvals are expected across the oncologic spectrum for a variety of other agents that target these pathways. The anti programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been recently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. "

PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.

Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each gene were cell-type specific. For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or \u0027piggyback\u0027 on signals used in alternative RNA processing. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression program. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs. "

Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the library was produced.

Although twin studies estimate that genetic factors account for 35-50% of the variance in human happiness, knowledge of specific genes is limited. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Results of studies on genetic factors indicated an average effectiveness of genetic about 35 -50 percent on happiness. Those with the syndrome have a predisposition toward apparent happiness and paroxysms of laughter, and this finding helps distinguish Angelman syndrome from other ones involving severe developmental handicap. This investigation examines association between happiness and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype. The clustering of the four different measures (quality of life in general, satisfaction with life, quality of life at present, and subjective happiness) was explained by an underlying additive genetic factor and an underlying non-additive genetic factor. The heritability of happiness was estimated at 22% for males and 41% in females. inally, a systematic review performed based on existing information. Biometric studies have shown that happiness is strongly affected by genes. happiness and the environment are influenced by genetic factors and family upbringing. "

In this review we assess our currently available knowledge about reflex seizures with special emphasis on the difference between \"generalized\" reflex seizures induced by visual stimuli, thinking, praxis and language tasks, and \"focal\" seizures induced by startle, eating, music, hot water, somatosensory stimuli and orgasm. Hot water epilepsy is rarely described in European countries, where bathing epilepsy in younger children is more common and often confused with this type of epilepsy. Hot water epilepsy (HWE) refers to a specific type of reflex epilepsy precipitated by the stimulus of bathing in hot water. Hot water epilepsy was triggered by contact with hot water either in the bath or by hand immersion, and VEEG showed fronto-parietal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent clobazam prophylaxis prior to head water bath might be a preferred mode of treatment of pure HWE. We studied the anatomical correlates of reflex hot water epilepsy (HWE) using multimodality investigations viz. The clinical and SPECT studies suggested temporal lobe as the seizure onset zone in some of the patients with HWE. "

      "ideal_answer": "By mapping DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related genes (including Esrrb, Prdm14, Dppa3, Klf2, Tcl1 and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for extraembryonic lineage differentiation. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 targets, ultimately contributing to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development. In this study, we show by genome-wide mapping that the newly discovered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is dynamically associated with transcription factor binding to distal regulatory sites during neural differentiation of mouse P19 cells and during adipocyte differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels.

The underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in KCNQ2, a K(+) channel gene. BFNC syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, as has been hypothesised to occur in Arabian foals, and is known to be caused by mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE). Sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. They also demonstrate that sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE syndromes. Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in Arabian foals resembles benign-familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC) syndrome, a rare idiopathic epilepsy of new-born humans. "

DisCons is an openly accessible sequence analysis tool that identifies and highlights structurally disordered segments of proteins where the conformational flexibility is conserved across homologs, and therefore potentially functional. The critical biological roles of these proteins, despite not adopting a well-defined fold, encouraged structural biologists to revisit their views on the protein structure-function paradigm. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable tertiary and/or secondary structures under physiological conditions in vitro. Intrinsically disordered proteins undergo significant conformational transitions to well folded forms only on binding to partner. Phosphorylation is a major post-translational mechanism of regulation that frequently targets disordered protein domains, but it remains unclear how phosphorylation modulates disordered states of proteins. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are ubiquitously involved in cellular processes and often implicated in human pathological conditions. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) frequently function in protein interaction networks that regulate crucial cellular signaling pathways. However, it lacks a stable fold in the absence of its binding partner. Many IDPs undergo transitions from disordered conformational ensembles to folded structures upon binding to their cellular targets. "

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations of the DCTN1 gene have been previously associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with Perry syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by weight loss, parkinsonism, central hypoventilation, and psychiatric disturbances. OBJECTIVES: Perry syndrome consists of autosomal dominant Parkinsonism, depression, weight loss, and central hypoventilation. A patient with a mood disorder and a Parkinsonian syndrome with frontal cognitive impairment thought to resemble progressive supranuclear palsy defied precise diagnosis until the development of respiratory compromise, prompting consideration of the diagnosis of Perry syndrome. Perry syndrome is a familial parkinsonism associated with central hypoventilation, mental depression, and weight loss. "

From a better knowledge of the genetic basis of SMA and the defects resulting from the mutations of SMN1 in cellular or animal models, several therapeutics strategies have been selected aiming at targeting SMN2, a partially functional copy of SMN1 gene which remains present in patients, or to prevent neurons from death.

Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16% of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of ∼2% of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. "

GDF-10 also shows significant homology to BMP-3 (approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity) in the pro- region of the molecule. In addition, GDF-10 mRNA was present in both neonatal and adult bone samples, with higher levels being detected in calvaria than in long bone. By Northern analysis, GDF-10 mRNA was detected primarily in murine uterus, adipose tissue, and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen.

Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules. "

Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense. Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome. These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility. Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. "

Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification. The MethylTranscriptome DataBase (MeT-DB, http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/) is the first comprehensive resource for N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mammalian transcriptome. Among these, the N(6)-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) modification is the most abundant and can be removed by specific mammalian enzymes.

Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3\u0027-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) contain tens of thousands of posttranscriptional chemical modifications.

      "ideal_answer": "Mechanism of action of flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA), in hypoactive sexual desire disorder. BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Sprout Pharmaceuticals is only for premenopausal women. Flibanserin is a novel multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA) that improves sexual functioning in premenopausal women who suffer from reduced sexual interest and desire. INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. "

When the age-related incidence of Crohn\u0027s disease was plotted for all countries from which such data were available, the peaks of greatest case frequency occurred at ages 15 to 25 years and paralleled a similar peak representing the number of Peyer\u0027s patches as a function of age. The peaks (20 and 50 years) may represent different phenotypes or different genetic and/or environmental influences between younger- and older-onset individuals. Crohn\u0027s disease (CD) diagnosed in pediatric patients has been reported to have a more aggressive phenotype and course, with a greater prevalence of upper gastrointestinal involvement, than in adults. For those with biologic use, average age at time of diagnosis of Crohn\u0027s disease was 32.3 ± 12.2 years, compared with 43.7 ± 16.3 years for those who had not received biologics (P \u003d 0.005).

The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo. The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications. The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis. Here, we show that the DNA transposon piggyBac can mobilize 100-kb DNA fragments in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, making it the only known transposon with such a large cargo capacity. DNA transposons have emerged as flexible and efficient molecular vehicles to mediate stable cargo transfer. However, the ability to carry DNA fragments\u003e10 kb is limited in most DNA transposons. Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint. "

We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. These findings demonstrate a potential link between FUS mutations and cellular pathways involved in stress responses that may be relevant to altered motor neuron homeostasis in ALS. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients.

These findings suggest that clearance of apoptotic cells in living vertebrates is accomplished by the combined actions of apoptotic cell migration and elmo1-dependent macrophage engulfment. Gi signalling and ELMO1 are both required for CXCL12-mediated actin polymerization, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, we identified Netrin-1 and its receptor Unc5B as upstream activators of the ELMO1/DOCK180 complex, regulating its functional interaction and leading to Rac1 activation in endothelial cells and vessel formation in zebrafish. Finally, in contrast to most other ERM-binding proteins, ELMO1 binding occurred independently of the state of radixin C-terminal phosphorylation, suggesting an ELMO1 interaction with both the active and inactive forms of ERM proteins and implying a possible role of ELMO in localizing or retaining ERM proteins in certain cellular sites. The data suggest that Src family kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 might represent an important regulatory mechanism that controls signaling through the ELMO1/Crk/Dock180 pathway. "

For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules.

The specific profile of gap junction proteins, the connexins, expressed in these different cell types forms compartments of intercellular communication that can be further shaped by the release of extracellular nucleotides via pannexin1 channels. zfPanx1 was identified on the surface of horizontal cell dendrites invaginating deeply into the cone pedicle near the glutamate release sites of the cones, providing in vivo evidence for hemichannel formation at that location. The membrane protein Pannexin1 forms two open-channel conformations depending on the mode of activation. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is a newly discovered extracellular ATP release channel with a wide tissue distribution and diverse biological functions in mammals. In mammals, a single pannexin1 gene (Panx1) is widely expressed in the CNS including the inner and outer retinae, forming large-pore voltage-gated membrane channels, which are involved in calcium and ATP signaling. We previously showed that pannexins form oligomeric channels but unlike connexins and innexins, they form only single membrane channels. Six of them form a \"gap junction hemichannel-like\" structure that connects the cytoplasm with the extracellular space; here they will be called Panx1 channels. "

This review covers the efficacy and safety of delamanid for MDR-TB.AREA COVERED: This paper reviews the pharmacological profile of delamanid and the results of clinical trials evaluating its efficacy for treating MDR-TB in combination with other anti-TB drugs. Delamanid (Deltyba(®)), a nitroimidazo-oxazole derivative, is a new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug which exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antitubercular activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EXPERT OPINION: Delamanid showed potent activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, decreased mortality was observed in MDR-TB patients who received\u003e6 months of delamanid treatment. Recently approved anti-Tb drugs (bedaquiline and delamanid) have the potential to induce arrhythmia and are recommended in patients with MDR-Tb when other alternatives fail. "

Surprisingly, a genome-wide expression analysis of H3K79 methylation-defective mutants identified only a few telomeric genes, such as COS12 at TEL-VII-L, to be subject to H3K79 methylation-dependent natural silencing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking Dot1 exhibit a complete loss of H3K79 methylation and defects in heterochromatin-mediated silencing. Since the discovery ∼10 years ago that Dot1 and its mammalian homolog, DOT1L (DOT1-Like), possess histone methyltransferase activity toward histone H3 Lys 79, great progress has been made in characterizing their enzymatic activities and the role of Dot1/DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, and the DNA damage response. H3K79me patterns, combined with the cytological analysis of the H3.3, γH2AX, macroH2A and H2A.Z histone variants, are consistent with a differential role for these epigenetic marks in male mouse meiotic prophase I. Together, our studies identified the evolutionarily conserved YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module and established a direct link between histone acetylation and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcription control.

Current meconium screening trials which may be effective in populations with the incidence equal to or greater than 1:2000, may be useful for populations with an incidence as low as 1:7000 only after maximum improvement of the methods. Studies on migrant Indian population in United States and United Kingdom estimate frequency of CF as 1:10,000 to 1:40,000. Although no careful scientific study had ever been done the impression was that CF was extremely rare among the Greek-Cypriots, with an incidence estimated at around 1:30,000.

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We conclude that Drosophila species are rich with UCEs and that many of them may correspond to novel noncoding RNAs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. "

Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin.

      "ideal_answer": "BACKGROUND: The Demons-Meigs syndrome should usually be evoked in case of presence of a typical triad: abdominopelvic mass, ascites and hydrothorax. BACKGROUND: The Meigs\u0027 syndrome is a rare but well-known syndrome defined as the triad of benign solid ovarian tumor, ascites, and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Meigs\u0027 syndrome should be considered at the differential diagnosis for a patient with pelvic mass, pleural effusion and ascites with normal cytology, increased CA125 levels. Although postmenopausal women with ovarian tumor, ascites, pleural effusion, and elevation of CA-125 levels probably have malignant ovarian tumors, Meigs\u0027 syndrome must be considered in the differential diagnosis. When benign ovarian fibroma is associated with ascites and/or pleural effusion it is termed Meigs syndrome. Meigs\u0027 syndrome is a benign ovarian tumor associated with ascites and pleural effusion. Ovarian mass, pleural effusion, and ascites: revisiting Meigs syndrome. "

      "ideal_answer": "R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes. The R-loop, previously characterized in vitro at the leading strand replication origin (OH), is isolated as a native RNA-DNA hybrid copurifying with mtDNA. Ginno et al. (2012) describe unusual sequence features at promoter CpG islands that can lead to formation of persistent RNA-DNA hybrids (R loops), which are proposed to prevent genomic DNA methylation. R-loops, transcriptionally-induced RNA:DNA hybrids, occurring at repeat tracts (CTG)n, (CAG)n, (CGG)n, (CCG)n and (GAA)n, are associated with diseases including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington\u0027s disease, fragile X and Friedreich\u0027s ataxia. We demonstrate, using biochemical and genetic approaches, that the formation of stable RNA.DNA hybrids enhances the instability of CTG.CAG repeat tracts. Double-R-loop formation and processing to instability was extended to the expanded C9orf72 (GGGGCC)·(GGCCCC) repeats, known to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, providing the first suggestion through which these repeats may become unstable. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. Periodic DNA patrolling underlies diverse functions of Pif1 on R-loops and G-rich DNA. "

One of these tests, Oncotype DXtrade mark, is a diagnostic test comprised of a 21-gene assay applied to paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, which allows physicians to predict subgroups of hormone-receptor-positive, node-negative patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy alone or require adjuvant chemotherapy to attain the best survival outcome. To evaluate the ability to guide treatment decisions in the group with a mid-range recurrence score, the North American Cooperative Groups developed the Trial Assessing IndiviuaLized Options for Treatment for breast cancer, a randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone on invasive disease-free survival-ductal carcinoma in situ (IDFS-DCIS) survival in women with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer with a recurrence score of 11-25. The TAILORx trial uses the Oncotype DX recurrence score to assign estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), node-negative patients to chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone. A cohort study was undertaken, including consecutive patients with early node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and May 2013, including a period of prospective clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualised Options for Treatment (TAILORx)) recruitment.

The coordination of lipid storage and utilization is regulated by the perilipin family of lipid droplet coat proteins [perilipin, adipophilin/adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), S3-12, tail-interacting protein of 47 kilodaltons (TIP47), and myocardial lipid droplet protein (MLDP)/oxidative tissues-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT)/lipid storage droplet protein 5 (LSDP5)]. The perilipins are a multi-protein family that targets lipid droplet surfaces and regulates lipid storage and hydrolysis. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which PAT family members, perilipin A, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), and LSDP5, control lipolysis catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a major lipase in adipocytes and several non-adipose cells. Lipid droplets of mammalian cells are coated with one or more members of the PAT protein family, which serve important functions in regulating lipolysis. Perilipin is a member of the evolutionarily related family of PAT proteins (Perilipin, Adipophilin, TIP47), which is defined by sequence similarity and association with lipid droplets. or the abundance of the lipid droplet coat proteins (perilipins 2, 3, 4, and 5) between treatments.

BACKGROUND: Gradenigo\u0027s syndrome is a rare disease, which is characterized by the triad of the following conditions: suppurative otitis media, pain in the distribution of the first and the second division of trigeminal nerve, and abducens nerve palsy. Gradenigo\u0027s syndrome is a rare but life threatening complication of acute otitis media (AOM), which includes a classic triad of otitis media, deep facial pain and ipsilateral abducens nerve paralysis. We report a case of typical Gradenigo\u0027s syndrome, including left abducens nerve palsy, left facial pain and paresthesia in V1 and V2 distribution of trigeminal nerve caused by solitary osseous plasmacytoma of the left petrous apex. Gradenigo\u0027s syndrome, the triad of suppurative otitis media, abducens nerve palsy and pain in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, remains a rare complication of otitis media. RESULTS: It was after Gradenigo that the well-known syndrome consisting of diplopia and facial pain due to a middle ear infection was named. "

The interaction of two water-soluble furocoumarins, 8-(omega-diethyl aminopropyloxy)psoralen hydrochloride (I) and its 5-isomer (II), with DNA has been investigated by spectroscopic, equilibrium dialysis, hydrodynamic and chiroptical techniques. Together with the previously published results it is concluded that both occupancy of the major and minor groove as well as intercalation hinder photobinding of furocoumarins to DNA. We have described an exonuclease III/photoreversal procedure to map, with base pair resolution, the bases which have photoreacted with 4,5\u0027,8-trimethylpsoralen (Me3-psoralen) forming either monoadducts or interstrand cross-links in DNA (20). Both compounds bind very efficiently to DNA, the extent of this process being modulated by the nature of substituents at position 8. Both compounds intercalate into the polynucleotide double helix. "

      "ideal_answer": "NETs, consisting of a chromatin meshwork decorated with antimicrobial peptides, play an important role in the innate response to microbial infections. NETs can also directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis. Clearance of NETs is impaired in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and NETosis is increased in neutrophils and, particularly, in low-density granulocytes derived from lupus patients. Further, lupus neutrophils - and, in particular, an aberrant subset called low-density granulocytes - have an increased propensity to undergo NETosis. Antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of secreted chromatin that may act as a source of autoantigens typical for SLE. NETs are toxic to the endothelium, expose immunostimulatory molecules, activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and may participate in organ damage through incompletely characterized pathways. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent an important defense mechanism against microorganisms. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released via a novel form of cell death called NETosis. Some lupus patients do not clear NETs normally, a phenotype that correlates with disease activity. "
