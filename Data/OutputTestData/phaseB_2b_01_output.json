      "ideal_answer": "Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disease. Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic disease with prominent cutaneous and brain involvement. Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance,. PEComas are related to the genetic alterations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant genetic disease due to losses of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3). Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene is responsible for the inherited genetic disease of tuberous sclerosis complex. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a frequent autosomal-dominant condition (affecting 1 in 6000 individuals) caused by various mutations in either the hamartin (TSC1) or the tuberin gene (TSC2). The tuberous sclerosis gene 2 product tuberin is an important regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. The effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling.

      "ideal_answer": "Metformin and glibenclamide are now increasingly viewed as a rational alternative to insulin therapy--a treatment both preferred by the women and a less expensive one, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, dietary supplementation with PB (6 g/kg extract for 4 weeks administered orally using an intragastric tube) ameliorated the alloxan-induced diabetes in a manner comparable with that of the reference antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. From clinical and practical point of view the findings would support the opinion that normal weight persons with IGT, particularly in already decreased insulin secretion, have an indication for a glibenclamide therapy. An improvement of the glucose tolerance could be observed up to 3 years, whereas after a 5-year glibenclamide therapy no certain influence on the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion could be proved. In general the improvement of the glucose tolerance was not associated with an increased secretion of insulin, so that an extrapancreatic effect of glibenclamide (improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity?). Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect. "

      "ideal_answer": "Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). When overexpressed, the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2 extends the lifespan of both budding yeast. Roles for sirtuin proteins at telomeres are thought to promote lifespan in yeast and mammals. In addition, Sir2 overexpression prevents Rif1 deletion from disrupting Sir2 at IGS1 and shortening lifespan. When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence. "

      "ideal_answer": "These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress. Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS). Sporadic juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity or Hirayama\u0027s disease (HD) and autosomal dominant motor distal neuronopathy/axonopathy (CMT2D/dSMA-V), produced by glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene mutations, share some clinical features including: young age of onset, predilection for the distal upper extremity, asymmetry, sparing of proximal muscles and unusual cold sensitivity. Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes. Mutations in the GARS gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V - allelic disorders characterized by predominantly distal upper extremity weakness and atrophy, typically beginning during the second decade of life.

Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%).

      "ideal_answer": "Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal \u0027IQ\u0027 domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides. Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. We characterized a family presenting with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death without ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities at rest. "

      "ideal_answer": "Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle. Ca2+ release from the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is regulated by a complex of proteins, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin (CSQ), junctin (JCN), and triadin 1 (TRD). Within this complex, calsequestrin, triadin, and JCN appear to be critical for normal regulation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium (Ca) release. The release of Ca from the SR may be regulated by the ryanodine receptor, triadin, junctin, calsequestrin, and a histidine-rich, Ca-binding protein (HRC). Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. Impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release has been suggested to contribute to the depressed cardiac function in heart failure. Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function. Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. "

      "ideal_answer": "Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear. The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome. Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. "

In three models of arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2(-/-) mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2(+/-) mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstabin2. In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2. JTV-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. After administration of isoproterenol under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality (2 of 10, 20%). In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%).

Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias. It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia. The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias.

The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle syndactyly mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed. The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome. These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space. Apert syndrome, characterised by craniosynostosis, craniofacial anomalies, and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits (cutaneous and bony fusion), has been associated with two canonical mutations in the FGFR2 gene (S252W, P253R) in the great majority of cases. In Apert syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. "

Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth. Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes. Type 1 \"classic\" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307]. "

The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the \"vicious cycle\" of bone destruction induced by these cells.

      "ideal_answer": "Post hoc testing revealed this compound to be nalmefene, a potent clinically used antagonist, thus further validating the model. The neurobiological mechanism by which opioid modulators affect drinking behavior is based on the strong connection between the endogenous opioid system, the dopamine system and the influence of the CNS stress response. Opioids that stimulate the μ-opioid receptor (MOR1) are the most frequently prescribed and effective analgesics. Molecular dynamics simulations show a ligand-dependent increase in the conformational flexibility of the third intracellular loop that couples with the G protein complex. From the 34 compounds predicted to be strong binders, the top three candidates were examined using biochemical assays. Naltrexone- and to a lesser extent nalmefene- is an agent that modulates opioidergic transmission in the CNS and it shows a limited but well-studied efficacy in treating alcohol dependence. Several derivatives of Naltrexone, Nalmefene (Nal) and JKB-119, exert immunomodulatory activity; however, unlike Nal, JKB-119 does not show significant opioid receptor antagonism. These simulations likewise identified residues that form frequent contacts with ligands. The model was used to blindly screen a library of ∼1.2 million compounds. One compound showed high efficacy and potency. Here we present a structural model of MOR1. "

      "ideal_answer": "Loxapine is an alternative when sedation is necessary and molindone is useful if a short-acting antipsychotic is required. All antipsychotic drug treatments examined in this study caused a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex. Compared to the tightly bound antipsychotic drugs, the more loosely bound antipsychotics generally require higher clinical doses, require fewer days for clinical adjustment, but may dissociate from the D2 receptor more rapidly and could lead to clinical relapse somewhat earlier than that found with the traditional tightly bound antipsychotic drugs. Pretreatment with molindone (0.45 and 0.8 mg/kg IP), in doses reported to selectively block the presynaptic DA receptors, not only decreased the cataleptic effect of AP but also reversed the AP antagonism of methamphetamine stereotypy. Other drugs of the typical (molindone and pimozide) and atypical (remoxipride) classes had no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue. "

This uncommon genetic disorder suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance, but almost all cases described are sporadic; the responsible gene is yet not located. The familial cases, the equal number of affected males and females, and the increased paternal age in sporadic cases strongly suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. Female transmission has been reported in the five previous well-documented cases of dominant inheritance of the syndrome. Although most cases are sporadic, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is well documented. This report presents the first example of male transmission of Apert acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome. The Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis and syndactyly of hands and feet. Apert syndrome, or acrocephalosyndactyly, is characterized by craniosynostosis and early epiphyseal closure resulting in various deformities of the skull, hands, and feet. Typically a sporadic condition, autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance has been known to occur. We report two observations of antenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome. "

      "ideal_answer": "The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis. Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured. The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred. Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C\u003eG, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3). Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. "

      "ideal_answer": "In the mean time, the use of chromatin insulators can reduce chances for retrovirus-mediated oncogenesis by inhibiting non-specific activation of nearby cellular proto-oncogenes. We conclude that the use of engineered piggyBac transposase mRNA and insulated transposons offer promising ways of improving the quality of the integration process and sustaining the expression of transposon vectors. Analysis of WAS protein expression in transduced human EBV-immortalized B-cells and transduced patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells also demonstrated stronger expression per copy from the MND promoter compared with the other promoters. Gamma-retroviral vectors enclosing these insulator elements were produced at titers similar to their non-insulated counterparts and proved to be less genotoxic in an in vitro immortalization assay, yielding lower activation of Evi1 oncogene expression and reduced clonal expansion of bone marrow cells. This study demonstrates that MAR sequences not necessarily increase transgene expression and that the effect of these sequences is probably context dependent and/or vector dependent. Compared with the EF1α and the WASp promoters, expression from the MND promoter in mouse transplant recipients was much higher in all lineages examined. Our results demonstrate that the Ig-κ MAR in the context of LV slightly increases transduction efficiency only in Hela, NIH-3T3 and Jurkat cells. "

      "ideal_answer": "Despite the fact that bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality and improvement in renal function, bariatric surgery has recently been shown to be associated with a significant risk of nephrolithiasis. The main risk factor for nephrolithiasis is increased excretion of urinary oxalate. Hyperoxaluria in patients with JIB was found to be a result of hyperabsorption of oxalate, and these patients displayed altered oxalate kinetics with continued urinary excretion of orally administered 14C-oxalate for more than 48 hours. Malabsorption of calcium and low fasting urinary calcium excretion in the JIB patients were associated with high tubular reabsorption of calcium, the latter presumably attributable to a compensatory increase in circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most recurrent renal stone formers the urinary calcium concentration was increased, with an inverse relationship to serum PTH, indicating intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium. The urinary excretion of oxalate was high: 1.112 mumol/24 h (normal range: 55-400 mumol/24 h), and citrate excretion was low: 1.48 mmol/24 h (normal range: 2-5 mmol/24 h). Enteric hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and oxalate nephropathy must be considered with the other risks of RYGBP. A. "

In conclusion these results indicated that treatment with melatonin in acute sports exercise reversed oxidative stress, improved defenses and lipid metabolism, which would result in an improvement in fitness. These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE. Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent. CoQ(10) supplementation before strenuous exercise decreases the oxidative stress and modulates the inflammatory signaling, reducing the subsequent muscle damage. Athletes and all those exposed to oxidative stress may benefit from the ability of these probiotics to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species. "

Loss of Lon1 in Arabidopsis changes the mitochondrial proteome leading to altered metabolite profiles and growth retardation without an accumulation of oxidative damage. Knockout in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to a significant growth rate deficit in both roots and shoots and lowered activity of specific mitochondrial enzymes associated with respiratory metabolism. the lack of Lon selective proteolysis leading to growth retardation and impaired seedling establishment can be attributed to defects in the oil reserve mobilization pathway. a genetic screen was performed that led to the identification of Arabidopsis thaliana Lon1 protease mutants that exhibit a post-embryonic growth retardation phenotype. mitochondria isolated from lon1 mutants had a lower capacity for respiration of succinate and cytochrome c via complexes II and IV, respectively. AtLon1 protease in organelle biogenesis and seedling establishment. Furthermore, the activity of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was significantly reduced. Additionally, mitochondria in lon1 mutants had an aberrant morphology. "

The dinucleotide CpG is significantly under-represented in vertebrate DNA and is usually methylated. One such pattern recognition system is based on unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in particular sequence contexts (CpG motifs); these motifs are common in bacterial DNA but are under-represented (\"CpG suppression\") and methylated in vertebrate DNA. We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context--which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans--is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. Unusual frequencies of certain alternating purine-pyrimidine runs in natural DNA sequences. Octanucleotides are the most deficient, occurring at only 60% of the frequency expected in random sequences.

In conclusion, resveratrol attenuated cardiac oxidative damage and left ventricular remodeling and enhanced the decreased expression of SIRT1 in hearts of old rats with emphysema and thus might be a therapeutic modality for cardiac injury complicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In conclusion, resveratrol is a beneficial pharmacological tool that augments autophagy to bring about reverse remodeling in the postinfarction heart. These findings indicate that RSV can constitute an adjuvant therapeutic option in DCM prevention. "

Overall, the phylogenetic diversity of As-resistant bacteria in underground water was very limited if compared with lentic and lotic waters. Lastly, our molecular data support the hypothesis that the horizontal gene transfer of ars in As-containing freshwater environments is not limited to closely-related genomes, but also occurs between bacteria that are distant from an evolutionary viewpoint, thereby indicating that such genetic events may be considered a source of microbial resistance to arsenic-toxicity. We postulate that the RND transporter All3143 and the predicted membrane fusion protein All3144, as homologs of E. coli AcrB and AcrA, respectively, are major players for antibiotic resistance in Anabaena sp. These observations suggest a physiological association between c-di-AMP and the MDR transporters and support the model that MDR transporters mediate c-di-AMP secretion to regulate peptidoglycan synthesis in response to cell wall stress. Our data suggest that SmbFT truly displays immunity function and confer protection against Smb and structurally similar lantibiotics. "

KCNQ1 is associated with two different entities of LQTS, the autosomal-dominant Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), and the autosomal-recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) characterized by bilateral deafness in addition to cardiac arrhythmias. This family showed typical features of this syndrome with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia, sudden death and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, deafness, and autosomal-recessive inheritance, and the Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by a prolonged QT interval, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and no deafness. The Romano-Ward syndrome shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and normal hearing. The Romano-Ward syndrome is of autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance.

Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare inherited disorder, characterised by periodic paralysis, cardiac dysarrhythmias, and dysmorphic features, and is caused by mutations in the gene KCNJ2, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1. Mutations of KCNJ2, the gene encoding the human inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1, cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a disease exhibiting ventricular arrhythmia, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic features. Some mutation carriers exhibited dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, small mandible, syndactyly, clinodactyly, cleft palate, and scoliosis, which, together with cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis, have been termed \"Andersen syndrome.\". Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis or Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes the distinct clinical features of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and facial and skeletal dysmorphisms and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance.

Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data. We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq). The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously. This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques. The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (mock control) subtraction and normalization within and across arrays.

The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3\u0027 UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P \u003d 1 × 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P \u003d 0.004 in 132 RA patients). Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity. Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit polymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, notably in mice, but also in some human populations. "

      "ideal_answer": "Like the histones, HU is able to condense DNA in vitro and to introduce negative super-coiling in covalently closed circular, relaxed DNA molecules in the presence of topoisomerase I. In prokaryotes and in the pool of vegetative phage DNA the most abundant histone-like protein HU is not associated with the bulk DNA, but localised in the border region with ribosomes where transcription and translation occur. We show that Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring (H-NS) protein can facilitate correct recognition of a promoter by RNA polymerase in AT-rich gene regulatory regions. We have characterized the role of HU in assembling the invertasome, an intermediate nucleoprotein complex involved in Hin-mediated site-specific recombination. In this study we show that these proteins can substitute for the prokaryotic DNA-bending protein HU in promoting the assembly of the Hin invertasome, an intermediate structure in Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion. Using ligase-mediated circularization of short DNA fragments we also show that HU, the high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins from mammals, and a protein from yeast can bend DNA extremely efficiently.

The mean LE adjusted for occupational group, marital status, and the age at entry to the cohort (and its 95% confidence limits) was in endurance sports (long distance running and cross-country skiing) 75.6 (73.6, 77.5) yr; in team games (soccer, ice hockey, basketball, as well as jumpers and short-distance runners from track and field (73.9 (72.7, 75.1) yr; in power sports (boxing, wrestling, weight lifting, and throwers from field athletics) 71.5 (70.4,. All the obtained results proved that high level physical activity in youth positively influenced men\u0027s mortality, what was observed for the former athletes even after 40 years since the end of their professional carrier. It appears that elite endurance (aerobic) athletes and mixed-sports (aerobic and anaerobic) athletes survive longer than the general population, as indicated by lower mortality and higher longevity. We found that former aerobic sports athletes (endurance and mixed sports) in particular have high total and active life expectancy and low risk for ischemic heart disease and diabetes in later years.

      "ideal_answer": "The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape. Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. "

      "ideal_answer": "The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT. Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5\u0027 phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase). In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5\u0027-phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II (polymerase II) during the early stages of transcription. Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript. Myc induces methyl cap formation by promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation which recruits the capping enzymes to RNA, and by up-regulating the enzyme SAHH (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase), which neutralizes the inhibitory by-product of methylation reactions. The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5\u0027-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5\u0027)pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells.

      "ideal_answer": "Inherited mutations in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. the effects of WRN silencing on cell proliferation and genomic instability are modulated probably by other genetic factors, including p53, which might play a role in the carcinogenesis induced by WRN deficiency. The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has been implicated to function in many nuclear processes, including DNA damage repair, recombination, transcription, ubiquitination, cell cycle checkpoint enforcement, and centrosome regulation. WRN depletion in HL60 cells led to the hyper-activation of homologous recombination repair via up-regulation of RAD51 and BLM protein levels. The specific DNA repair systems for which there are data regarding the impact of repair defects on stem cell function include O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous DNA end-joining Fanconi\u0027s anemia protein complex, and homologous recombination. This review mainly focuses on various roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in the development of cancer and premature aging.

      "ideal_answer": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by mutation in either Tsc1 or Tsc2 genes that leads to the hyper activation of the mTOR pathway, a key signalling pathway for synaptic plasticity. TSC1/2 genes play a fundamental role in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of the GTPase activity of Rheb. Recent findings from this laboratory and others suggests that the tumour suppressor complex made of two proteins TSC1/hamartin and TSC2/tuberin, acts as a negative regulator of mTOR/S6K1 signalling. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex normally acts on Rheb to mediate mTOR/S6K1-signalling. It acts downstream of nutrient signalling as the direct target of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and upstream of mTOR/S6K1/4EBP in the insulin-signalling pathway. Recent studies suggest that the tuberous sclerosis complex Tsc1-Tsc2 may couple insulin signalling to Tor activity. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are genetically linked to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, which can lead to severe pathological consequences, including mental retardation, epilepsy and autism, as well as cardiac, pulmonary and renal failure.

These results show that in vitro on eukaryotic ribosomes where the Shine-Dalgarno-type interaction is not possible, high efficiency frameshifting around the in-phase stop codon in the RF-2 mRNA can still occur. These studies indicated that ribosomes bypass the leaky termination sites at efficiencies ranging from essentially 0 to ca. 5% depending upon the viral sequence. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a stop codon in a large ORF may not always correspond to a sequencing error, or a pseudogene, but can be a recoding signal in a functional gene. This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. These results suggest that in tomato tissues, GPR is made as part of a longer polypeptide by some translational mechanism that enables bypass of the internal stop codon, such as frameshifting or ribosome hopping.

Rapamycin and its related analogs such as Temsirolimus and Everolimus are less toxic for humans compared with other anti-VEGFR inhibitors and has been used as an immunosuppressive agent. Target of rapamycin inhibitors (TOR-I) (sirolimus, everolimus) are immunosuppressive agents with a novel mode of action. With the recent approval of two mTOR-targeted drugs (temsirolimus and everolimus) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma, this paradigm has been effectively translated into the clinical setting. The mTOR pathway, and its upstream regulators in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT cascade, are altered in a variety of experimental and human malignancies.This has led to the prediction that mTOR inhibitors may be used as anticancer agents. In this cell model, octreotide and RAD001 appear to act through a similar pathway and inhibit the Akt-mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway downstream of Akt. These three classes are tyrosine kinase inhibitors with sunitinib and sorafenib, the anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab which is associated with alpha interferon in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer) and mTOR inhibitors with temsirolimus and everolimus. The introduction of the inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols substantially. "

      "ideal_answer": "Our results identify a function for DXPas34 in murine XCI and demonstrate the critical role of Tsix transcription in preventing XCI in differentiating male ES cells and in normal functioning of the counting pathway. Albeit, the precise molecular mechanism is still obscure it has been shown that Tsix transcription regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter. A counting process senses the X chromosome/autosome ratio and ensures that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiates in the early female (XX) embryo and in differentiating female ES cells but not in their male (XY) counterparts. Counting depends on the X inactivation center (Xic), which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing. This region contains the major and minor promoters of the Tsix gene, which runs antisense to Xist. A conservation of Tsix expression pattern in voles, rat and mice suggests a crucial role of the antisense transcription in regulation of Xist and XIC in rodents. "

Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), characterized by skin neurofibromas and an excess of café-au-lait spots, is due to mutations in the neurofibromin (NF1) gene.

The studies implied the negative effects of NSAIDs, such as aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors, which suppress prostanoid production during tissue regeneration for infarcted heart when using hESCs. "

Serum screening showed that 1,244 (5%) were Down syndrome positive and 105 (0.4%) were Edwards syndrome positive. There was evidence of space-time clustering for Down syndrome (fixed threshold of close in space: P \u003d 0.01, NN threshold: P \u003d 0.02), but little or no clustering for Patau (P \u003d 0.57, P \u003d 0.19) or Edwards (P \u003d 0.37, P \u003d 0.06) syndromes. 235 pregnancies of women delivered in units in the North West Thames region over a two-year period (1990-91) whose babies or fetuses were diagnosed as having Down, Edwards or Patau syndrome. The live birth prevalence in the absence of prenatal screening and selective termination in England and Wales from 1997 to 2004 was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.6). RESULTS: 33% of Down syndrome, 68% of Edwards syndrome and 52% of Patau syndrome were diagnosed prenatally (before 28 weeks) in the region without the use of serum screening. "

      "ideal_answer": "In an animal model of AMI relevant to the human disease, intracoronary administration of IGF-1/HGF is a practical and effective strategy to reduce pathological cardiac remodeling, induce myocardial regeneration, and improve ventricular function. hCSCs expressing only IGF-1R synthesize both IGF-1 and IGF-2, which are potent modulators of stem cell replication, commitment to the myocyte lineage, and myocyte differentiation, which points to this hCSC subset as the ideal candidate cell for the management of human heart failure. In physiologic conditions, cardiac overexpression of the IGF-1Ea propeptide is associated with an enrichment of c-Kit/Sca-1 positive side population cells in the bone marrow and the occurrence of an endothelial-primed CD34 positive side population in the heart. We tested whether cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) implanted in proximity of healed infarcts or resident CPCs stimulated locally by hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 invade the scarred myocardium and generate myocytes and coronary vessels improving the hemodynamics of the infarcted heart. In conclusion, constitutive overexpression of IGF-1 prevented activation of cell death in the viable myocardium after infarction, limiting ventricular dilation, myocardial loading, and cardiac hypertrophy.

Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder caused by the arrest of myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, leading to a non compacted endocardial layer with marked hypertrabeculation and deep recesses. Prominent hypertrabecularisation (ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium \u003e2) in the apical and mid left ventricular segments is typical for non-compaction cardiomyopathy. LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, heart failure in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious sick sinus syndrome (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients. Sudden cardiac death (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40). Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved in all the cases. The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%\u003e. "

      "ideal_answer": "The cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and stem cell factor may play a role in helping to stimulate cell regeneration under normal physiologic conditions and in patients with myocardial injury. However, results from recent clinical trials did not support beneficial effects of cytokine therapy with G-CSF or erythropoietin alone in patients with myocardial infarction. In preclinical study, G-CSF and erythropoietin improved cardiac function and perfusion by angiomyogenesis and protection of cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction. EPO in patients with STEMI treated with PCI is associated with an increase in diameter stenosis that is not associated with circulating progenitor cells. Transplantation of MSC combined with cytokine EPO is superior to either of the monotherapy approach for angiomyogenesis and cardiac function recovery. Epo overexpression enhances the cellular regenerative properties of MSCs by both autocrine and paracrine pathways. "

      "ideal_answer": "Thus, TGFβ signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration. As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts. Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1). Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging. After injury, the presence of macrophages, which secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, led to rapid removal of cell debris and replacement by granulation tissue containing inflammatory cells and blood vessels, followed by myofibroblast infiltration and collagen deposition. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration. Secretion of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A as well as neovascularization, myofibroblast infiltration, and collagen deposition decreased. "

We present, for the first time, a novel loss-of-function mutation coding for an L-type calcium channel subunit. however, a new variant at a heterozygous state was identified in the CACNA2D1 gene (nucleotide c.2264G \u003e C; amino acid p.Ser755Thr), coding for the Ca(v)α(2)δ-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel. To date, three different mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1 and KCNJ2) have been identified as causing short QT syndrome. Gain of function mutations in three genes encoding K(+) channels have been identified, explaining the abbreviated repolarization seen in this condition: KCNH2 for I(kr) (SQT1), KCNQ1 for I(ks) (SQT2) and KCNJ2 for I(k1) (SQT3). To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome. Genetic analysis has, to date, identified three distinct forms of the condition, involving gain-of-function mutations to three different cardiac potassium channel genes: KCNH2 (SQT1), KCNQ1 (SQT2) and KCNJ2 (SQT3). Three different gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding for cardiac potassium channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified up to now to cause short QT syndrome. "

      "ideal_answer": "Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. From 1993, the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) came to our attention, as a new inherited \"electrical disease\" associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. Mutations of Ikr, Iks, Ikl channels cause dysfunctional Iks, Ikr, Ikl channels with an increase in the net outward K current leading to shortening of repolarization. This in turn leads to a shorter QT interval on the ECG and shorter atrial and ventricular refractory periods with increased susceptibility to VF and AF. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested. There seems to be an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. "

      "ideal_answer": "No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH. This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TRα1. Heterozygous 2- to 3-week- old mice exhibit a severe retardation of post-natal development and growth, but only a minor reduction in serum thyroxine levels. The data demonstrate a novel array of effects mediated by a dominant negative TRalpha1, and may provide important clues for identification of a potentially unrecognized human disorder and its treatment. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. "

      "ideal_answer": "Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome due to mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina proteins, lamins A/C (LMNA) or prelamin A processing enzyme, and zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE24). genetic defects in the nuclear envelope protein prelamin A or in the FACE-1 metalloprotease (also called Zmspte24) involved in prelamin A proteolytic maturation, cause the accumulation of an abnormal form of this protein and the subsequent disruption of nuclear envelope integrity. The genetic basis in most cases is a mutation at the nucleotide position 1824 of the lamin A gene. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and mandibuloacral dysplasia are well-recognized allelic autosomal dominant and recessive progeroid disorders, respectively, due to mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. we present evidence of mutations in lamin A (LMNA) as the cause of this disorder. The underlying defect is usually a homozygous mutation of LMNA, or a combined defect of LMNA and another gene, for example, ZMPSTE-24. "

      "ideal_answer": "National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside randomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or quality of life in men with screen-detected disease. Mass screening is costly, may result in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers that never become clinically significant, and the evidence of a subsequent reduction in mortality is inconclusive. Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. In the countries investigated, physicians and other information sources appear to have little impact on improving citizens\u0027 perceptions of these benefits. Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom. Although the evidence is contradictory, PSA is still an important tool for monitoring patient progression following treatment of definitive localized prostate cancer. Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a small part. The vast majority of citizens in nine European countries systematically overestimate the benefits of mammography and PSA screening. "

Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome. Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis. The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins. Once detected, these patients may be offered more aggressive treatment strategies such as early pharmacotherapy in addition to life style changes targeted to maintaining pericyte integrity. These results might be indicative of early proatherogenic processes in this group of patients who are otherwise at low risk for atherosclerosis. "

      "ideal_answer": "Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted. A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) chromosomal analysis. WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. "

      "ideal_answer": "Since the landmark study on rheumatoid arthritis, many reports have suggested that physiological changes during pregnancy often induce remission of systemic and cutaneous inflammatory diseases. Literature review shows that at best, there are weak negative associations between current estrogen use and RA, and no association with nulliparity and infertility. It appears that infertility, the number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome are not strongly associated with the risk of developing RA in women of childbearing age. Most other published studies find no association between nulliparity and RA. an early age at first birth increased the odds, and the postpartum period was confirmed as high risk for RA onset. The protective effect of repeated exposure to the ameliorating hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy may counterbalance the effect of early exposure to the postpartum reversal of these changes. In this unique population, greater parity significantly reduced the odds of RA;. We found an inverse correlation between the number of pregnancies and age at onset of RA. However, in this study there may have been selection biases in the women with RA and the controls that differentially could have affected their reproductive outcomes. "

In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P(nom)≤0.004,. Human L-ferritin deficiency is characterized by idiopathic generalized seizures and atypical restless leg syndrome. We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors. To date, no gene mutation has been found, but five gene loci have been mapped in primary RLS to chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, and 20p (RLS1 through 5). Our family with a rather homogeneous phenotype and very early disease onset represents a unique opportunity to further elucidate the genetic causes of the frequent restless leg syndrome. Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin. A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. "

The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common,. All of the parents of our patients had difficult times to make their children sleep due to irritability, restlessness, and demanding bedtime routines. Intravenous iron administration, especially in those requiring treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is an essential component of the management of anemia in ESRD patients. All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. "

The genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759 corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included the GATA1 gene. We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a sex-linked trait. X-linked gray platelet syndrome due to a GATA1 Arg216Gln mutation. "

Introducing to the 80% formic acid injection solution an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or acetonitrile-DMSO induced further retention selectivity, and increasing levels of organic solvents reduced on-column retention. We found that the quantitative precisions improved significantly when DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) was added to the matrix solution. "

This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Our large-scale cross-sectional study found that problem behaviors in adolescents were associated with sleep problems, including sleep bruxism, as well as lifestyle and food habits and GERD symptoms. The frequencies of EMG bursts, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, grinding noise, and the RMMA/microarousal ratio were significantly higher in the 20-minute period after acidic infusion than after saline infusion. most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position.

      "ideal_answer": "Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures. Both blood and urine biomarkers are reviewed in this paper and offer a considerable opportunity to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and known epidemiology of these recently defined syndromes. Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. Both blood and urine biomarkers, including the assessment of catalytic iron, a critical element to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress, are reviewed in this paper. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. "

As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements. Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis. Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli. To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes. The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors. "

This treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression.

The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects. The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both α- and β-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol. DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure. DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R. Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD. Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply. Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. "

Among 5,511 males, 69 subjects (1.25%) exhibited QTc \u003c 354 msec(1/2) (2 standard deviations [SDs] below the mean in males), and among 5,473 females, 89 subjects (1.63%) exhibited QTc \u003c 364 msec(1/2) (2 SDs below the mean in females). We chose patients with a short Bazett QTc interval from a database consisting of 114,334 patients to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of a short QT interval. RESULTS: A total of 427 patients (mean age 43.4 ± 22.4 years) had a short QT interval with about a 1.2 times higher male predominance (234 men). Of the 19,153 subjects, two met the criteria of short QT interval and allowed for prevalence and incidence estimates for short QT interval as 0.01% and 0.39/100,000 person-years, respectively. The prevalence of QT interval \u003c320 ms based on QTc, QTfc, and QTnc was 0.10%, 0.08%, and 0.06%, and the prevalence of QT interval \u003c340 ms was 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively. "

An intronic mutation (c.4810+3_4810+6dupGGGT) in the SCN5A gene, located outside the consensus splice site, was detected in this study in a family with a highly variable clinical phenotype of Brugada syndrome and/or conduction disease and in a patient with Brugada syndrome. RESULTS: From a novel SCN5A mutation (c.664C\u003eT; p.Arg222X) identified in a proband with the characteristic electrocardiographic pattern and the history of sudden collapse, 122 family members were studied including 40 carriers of the mutation. This was the first study to systematically investigate sodium channel variants in Chinese patients with ARVD; a new SCN5A mutation, I137M, was found. We screened patients with SUNDS for mutations in SCN5A, the gene known to cause Brugada syndrome, as well as genes encoding ion channels associated with the long-QT syndrome. Genetic screening failed to identify SCN5A mutations in most cases but demonstrated a novel double missense mutation (K1527R and A1569P) located on the same allele in another asymptomatic subject (case 2).

We studied the dynamics of constitutive heterochromatin in the stages prior to embryonic genome activation by distribution analysis of heterochromatin protein CBX1 (HP1), centromeric proteins CENPA and CENPB, and histone H3 three-methylated at lysine 9. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates interaction between PARP-2 and its functional homolog PARP-1, constitutive centromere proteins Cenpa and Cenpb, and spindle checkpoint protein Bub3, but not with a third constitutive centromere protein Cenpc. By systematic deletion of CENPA chromatin-containing regions of variable length of different chromosomes, followed by mapping of neocentromere loci in C. albicans and its related species Candida dubliniensis, which share similar centromere properties, we demonstrate that the chromosomal location is an evolutionarily conserved primary determinant of CENPA deposition. Many well characterized markers of embryonic stem cells including CD9, PODXL and centromere-specific histone-H3-like protein CENPA are consistently expressed in TGCTs. This review highlights the role and dynamics of CENPA assembly into centromeres and the potential contribution of this kinetochore protein to autoimmune and cancer diseases in humans. "

We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P\u003d.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual. However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA. he HLA locus, particularly HLA-DRB1, is its strongest genetic risk determinant across ethnicities. Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis).

Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan\u0027s syndrome. A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise. "

Twenty-two (28%) participants were wearing commercially available chest barriers, including 7 in whom the projectile made direct contact with protective padding (baseball catchers and lacrosse/hockey goalies), and 2 in whom the projectile was a baseball specifically designed to reduce risk. Several measures, such as the use of safety baseballs and the use of chest protectors, can help protect young athletes from commotio cordis. This study evaluates the effectiveness of chest protectors in reducing the risk of commotio cordis. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Catastrophic injuries included 23 severe head injuries, 8 cervical injuries, 3 cases of commotio cordis, and 2 cases each of a collapsed trachea and facial fractures. Not unexpectedly, the groups differed with baseball/softball and football predominant in the United States (55% of events) and soccer, cricket, and hockey most common internationally (47% of events).

Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without gross structural damage of the heart and internal organs. Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without structural damage of the heart and internal organs. Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Although blunt, nonpenetrating chest blows causing sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis) are often associated with competitive sports, dangers implicit in such blows can extend into many other life activities.

The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young athletes is estimated to be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated. The sudden death of athletes under 35 years engaged in competitive sports is a well-known occurrence; the incidence is higher in athletes (approximately 2/100,000 per year) than in non-athletes (2.5 : 1), and the cause is cardiovascular in over 90%. Sudden cardiac death in a young athlete is a tragic and marking event, even though the media attention it gets is more important than its incidence (1-2/100000 per year). The incidence of SCD is expected at one case for each 200,000 young athletes per year. "

      "ideal_answer": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disease caused by lack of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. Because methylation analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS. Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown. "
