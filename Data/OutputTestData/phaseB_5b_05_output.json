AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of follow up for the primary outcome, death (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06), or in poor outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21). During the treatment period, fewer patients developed delayed cerebral ischaemia in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). "

      "ideal_answer": "Coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase, complexes that are crucial to pre-messenger RNA splicing and telomere maintenance, respectively. coilin is tightly associated with nucleic acid, displays RNase activity in vitro, and is redistributed to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-rich nucleoli in cells treated with the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide. Additionally, we provide evidence of coilin involvement in the processing of human telomerase RNA both in vitro and in vivo. Extensive studies have characterized the interaction between coilin and the various other protein components of CBs and related subnuclear domains; however, only a few have examined interactions between coilin and nucleic acid. Here, we report a specific in vivo association between coilin and rRNA, U small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and human telomerase RNA, which is altered upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence of coilin interaction with specific regions of U snRNA gene loci. Here, I would like to discuss what we have learned about coilin and suggest a possible role for coilin in RNA processing and cellular trafficking, especially in relation to Cajal bodies and nucleoli.

To the authors\u0027 knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the association between SNPs within UCEs and clinical outcome in patients with CRC. The results suggested that SNPs within UCEs may be valuable prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced CRC who receive 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Our results strongly suggest that several genetic variants in the UCEs may contribute to CRC susceptibility, individually and jointly, and that different genetic etiology may be involved in RCRC and LCRC. Genetic variants within ultraconserved elements and susceptibility to right- and left-sided colorectal adenocarcinoma. "

We detected a homozygous missense mutation (c.4189T\u003eG, p.F1397V) in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which is described as the causative gene for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism. "

Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are a suitable vector for gene therapy studies because of desired characteristics such as low immunogenicity, transfection of non-dividing and dividing cells, and long-term expression of the transgene. Over the last five years, the number of clinical trials involving AAV (adeno-associated virus) and lentiviral vectors continue to increase by about 150 trials each year. . Using these criteria, we then evaluate approaches made to model PD using viral vectors to date, including both adeno-associated viruses and lentiviruses. describes commonly used gene therapeutics (herpes simplex viral vector (HSV) and adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)). For continued success, AAV and lentiviral expression cassettes need to be designed to meet each disease\u0027s specific needs. This study examined the efficacy of gene therapy of lung adenocarcinoma using specifically controlled type I herpes simplex virus recombinant vector expressing Gibbon ape leukemia virus membrane fusion glycoprotein gene (GALV.fus).

      "ideal_answer": "Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions. "

Currently nine genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins (RP), have been found mutated in approximately 50% of patients. Three genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been associated to DBA: after RPS19, mutations in genes RPS24 and RPS17 were recently identified in a fraction of the patients. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 have recently been found in 25% of patients with either the dominant or the sporadic form. A transgenic mouse model demonstrates a dominant negative effect of a point mutation in the RPS19 gene associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited erythroblastopenia associated with mutations in at least 8 different ribosomal protein genes. In 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia 19q13 gene mutation was detected, and recent findings suggest another gene located on 8p23.3-p22. Mutation of ribosomal protein RPS24 in Diamond-Blackfan anemia results in a ribosome biogenesis disorder. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that DBA is primarily the result of defective ribosome synthesis. "

The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations. Sperm segregation analysis of a (13;22) Robertsonian translocation carrier by FISH: a comparison of locus-specific probe and whole chromosome painting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of metaphase chromosomes of carriers of rob(21q22q) revealed breakpoint diversity for this rare type of Robertsonian translocation chromosome. ROBs are whole-arm rearrangements between the acrocentric chromosomes 13-15, 21, and 22. ROBs can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations). To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q). The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes.

To compare the performance of two interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and conventional screening tests in patients with inflammatory arthritis undergoing screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) compounds. We present two patients with inflammatory bowel disease who, despite negative tuberculosis screening, developed a de novo tuberculosis infection after the start of anti tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment. TNFalpha plays a pivotal role not only in the inflammatory process but also in the normal response against pathogens and therefore, interfering with this cytokine may increase the risk of infection. The use of TNFalpha blockers is associated with reactivation of tuberculosis (TB). "

Overall, our data are consistent with a model wherein a single molecule of bezlotoxumab neutralizes TcdB by binding via its two Fab regions to two epitopes within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain, partially blocking the carbohydrate binding pockets of the toxin and preventing toxin binding to host cells. We demonstrate here through various biophysical approaches that bezlotoxumab binds to specific regions within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain. We compared the bezlotoxumab epitopes in the TcdB receptor binding domain across known TcdB sequences and found that key substitutions within the bezlotoxumab epitopes correlated with the relative differences in potencies of bezlotoxumab against TcdB of some strains, including ribotypes 027 and 078. A combination of the anti-TcdA antibody actoxumab and the anti-TcdB antibody bezlotoxumab is currently under development for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infections. Mechanism of action and epitopes of Clostridium difficile toxin B-neutralizing antibody bezlotoxumab revealed by X-ray crystallography. "

Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR. "

Harnessing the power of multiple species comparisons to detect genomic elements under purifying selection, CEGA provides a comprehensive set of CNCs identified at different radiations along the vertebrate lineage. The dynamic CEGA web interface displays alignments, genomic locations, as well as biologically relevant data to help prioritize and select CNCs of interest for further functional investigations.

      "ideal_answer": "Cryptochromes, blue-light absorbing proteins involved in the circadian clock, have been proposed to be the receptor molecules of the avian magnetic compass. The molecular basis for magnetoreception has recently been elucidated in fruitfly as complexes between the magnetic receptor magnetoreceptor (MagR) and its ligand cryptochrome (Cry). Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs). Biogenic magnetic particles have been detected in some migratory insects, which implies the basis of magnetoreception mechanism for orientation and navigation. The leading hypothesis centers on radical pairs-magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates formed by photoexcitation of cryptochrome proteins in the retina. The photoreceptor protein cryptochrome is thought to host, upon light absorption, a radical pair that is sensitive to very weak magnetic fields, endowing migratory birds with a magnetic compass sense. Although it has been known for almost half a century that migratory birds can detect the direction of the Earth\u0027s magnetic field, the primary sensory mechanism behind this remarkable feat is still unclear. Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly understood sensory ability, described mainly on the basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa. Magnetoreception is essential for magnetic orientation in animal migration. "

The clinical features of sudden onset of generalized edema, initial heavy proteinuria and initial severe hypoalbuminemia might help identify the subset of patients, especially in low grade IgAN. We analyzed medical records of 290 patients with diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome as defined by International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), between January 1987 and December 2000, at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar. Twelve patients with IgAN with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and followed up. Most patients presented within 3 months duration (61.4%) and the most common symptom was puffiness of face (98.45%) followed by pedal edema (91%). Oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome. All patients presented with generalized edema. Nephrotic syndrome is an unusual manifestation of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN).

Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception. The discovery of new genes essential for sensing pain (SCN11A, PRDM12, and CLTCL1) has provided unexpected insights into the biological mechanisms that drive distinct stages of nociception. However, the study of genetic disorders rendering individuals completely unable to feel pain offers hope. The evolutionarily conserved transcription factor PRDM12 controls sensory neuron development and pain perception. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis. All causes of congenital painlessness affect nociceptors, evolutionarily conserved specialist neurons able to sense all type of tissue damage. Here we show that PRDM12 is a key regulator of sensory neuronal specification in Xenopus. New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). "

CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. "

Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. This study establishes the FKHs role as evolutionarily conserved regulators of lifespan in yeast and identifies the APC as a novel component of this mechanism under certain conditions, likely through combined regulation of stress response, genomic stability, and cell cycle regulation. Here we show that the yeast forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, associate with the coding regions of active genes and influence, in opposing ways, transcriptional elongation and termination. Our results suggest that, in addition to their documented promoter function, Fkh1p and Fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation and pre-mRNA processing. We report that the deletion of both FKH genes impedes normal lifespan and stress resistance, particularly in stationary phase cells, which are non-responsive to caloric restriction. "

Mutations in the CIP-box motifs of the Dna2 nuclease or the rDNA-associated protein Tof2 do not perturb DNA synthesis genome-wide, but instead lead to a dramatic shortening of chromosome 12 that contains the large array of rDNA repeats. Most strikingly, Ctf4-dependent recruitment of CIP-box proteins couples other processes to DNA synthesis, including rDNA copy-number regulation. Crystallographic analysis classifies CIP-boxes into two related groups that target different sites on Ctf4. Our data reveal unexpected complexity of Ctf4 function, as a hub that connects multiple accessory factors to the replisome. "

Although the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 5\u0027-to-3\u0027 DNA helicase Pfh1 is known to promote fork progression, its genomic targets, dynamics, and mechanisms of action are largely unknown. DNA replication through hard-to-replicate sites, including both highly transcribed RNA Pol II and Pol III genes, requires the S. pombe Pfh1 helicase. Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry.

Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe mental retardation, microcephaly, long narrow face, ocular anomalies, and long thin hands and feet. BACKGROUND: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) is a developmental disorder characterised by reduced growth, microcephaly, ocular anomalies (microcornea, strabismus, myopia, and pale optic disk), distinctive facial features (narrow palpebral fissures, telecanthus, sparse and laterally broad eyebrows, preauricular tags, and micrognathia), mental retardation, and generalised hypotonia. Genetic syndromes involving both brain and eye abnormalities are numerous and include syndromes such as Warburg micro syndrome, Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome, Kahrizi syndrome and others. A pair of sisters was ascertained for multiple congenital defects, including marked craniofacial dysmorphisms with blepharophimosis, and severe psychomotor delay. Both showed psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, blepharophimosis and delayed growth as the main features; the infant also presented preauricular tags and large clitoris. "

Our findings reveal a novel model for an intestinal bowel disease phenotype that occurs upon combined loss of the DNA repair cofactors ATMIN and NBS1. We show loss of NBS1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive stage of T cell development, as well as reduced TCRα recombination, that was unexpectedly neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In contrast, loss of both ATMIN and NBS1 enhanced DNA damage that drove spontaneous peripheral T cell hyperactivation, proliferation as well as excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a highly inflammatory environment. In vivo this resulted in severe intestinal inflammation, colitis and premature death. Here, we investigate the roles of ATMIN and NBS1, either alone or in combination, using murine models. Intriguingly, the disease causing T cells were largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS1. "

CRS type II: chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction. Chronic cardio-renal syndrome (type 2): chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction.

UNLABELLED: Triple A syndrome (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal failure, progressive neurodegenerative disease) is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene which encodes the protein alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN). Patients usually display the triad of achalasia, alacrima, and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) insensitive adrenal insufficiency, though the presentation is inconsistent. Its cardinal symptoms are achalasia, alacrima, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity. Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare disease, and presents mainly in children. "

      "ideal_answer": "We demonstrate that the circular RNA circ-Foxo3 was highly expressed in non-cancer cells and were associated with cell cycle progression. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated regions of messenger RNAs. Ectopic expression of circ-Foxo3 repressed cell cycle progression by binding to the cell cycle proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (also known as cell division protein kinase 2 or CDK2) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (or p21), resulting in the formation of a ternary complex. A significantly positive correlation was observed for the expression profiles of some circRNAs and their parent genes. Numerous circRNAs were specifically expressed at different lactation stages, and only 1,314 circRNAs were detected at both lactation stages. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. "

We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell\u0027s chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome. "

      "ideal_answer": "The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. The tyrosine kinase abl-related gene ARG is fused to ETV6 in an AML-M4Eo patient with a t(1;12)(q25;p13): molecular cloning of both reciprocal transcripts. To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs. Ultraviolet-A and -B differentially modify the tyrosine-kinase profile of human keratinocytes and induce the expression of Arg+. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. The human Arg (Abl2) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase has a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements by its C-terminal F-actin- and microtubule-binding sequences. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton. One isoform of Arg/Abl2 tyrosine kinase is nuclear and the other seven cytosolic isoforms differently modulate cell morphology, motility and the cytoskeleton. "

We suggest that the circles arise from normal splicing processes as a consequence of the unusual genomic structure surrounding the Sry locus in the mouse. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. However, the characteristics and the critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well recognized until the \"microRNA sponge\" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7 (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. While this result does not prove a direct interaction between the two genes, it defines the critical period during which Sry must act to initiate Sertoli cell differentiation. "

      "ideal_answer": "MPE-seq, a new method for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. In particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression. The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. "

Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain. Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max. As identified by co-IP, p300 interacted with the C-terminal TAD domain of MRTF-A. p300 worked synergistically with MRTF-A to activate the transcription of MYH9, MYL9 and CYR61. "

Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies). OBJECTIVE: Arboleda et al. have recently shown that IMAGe (intra-uterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital abnormalities) syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of maternally expressed gene CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5. IMAGe syndrome is an exceedingly rare condition first described in 1999. Components of the syndrome are intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia and genital anomalies. "

Using gene expression profiles from macrophages obtained from synovial fluid of RA patients, we searched for genes highly correlated with FCGR2A expression. DHX32 and RGS12 were the most consistently correlated genes with FCGR2A expression in RA synovial fluid macrophages (P\u003c0.001). The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative for RF (OR \u003d 6.2(2.4-16.3),p.

The trained classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using expression information from a full genome tiling array. In this work we present a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Our work combines both analytical and experimental techniques to show that SSCprofiler is a highly accurate tool which can be used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates in the human genome. Finally, four of the top scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis. SSCprofiler is freely available as a web service at http://www.imbb.forth.gr/SSCprofiler.html. "

      "ideal_answer": "Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes. The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4. By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners. Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone that can assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation. Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4. This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3. The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail. The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms. An ASF1-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus. "

      "ideal_answer": "The most serious side effect of prolonged aspirin treatment is haemorrhage, especially from the GI tract. Balancing the benefit of ASCVD reduction with the risk of bleeding from low-dose aspirin is difficult but essential for informed decision making and achieving a net clinical benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. We report for the first time, in a typical risk US clinical population, a lack of protective association of aspirin for polyps among active smokers. Evidence for an association between aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been inconsistent. Future prospective studies are recommended to confirm this mitigating effect in order to improve the precision of the growing evidence base about the chemopreventive benefit of aspirin in colorectal cancer. Long-term aspirin use was associated with a modest but significantly reduced risk for overall cancer, especially gastrointestinal tract tumors. Overall, our results do support the hypothesis that use of NSAIDs or statins may reduce the odds of developing pancreatic cancer. Regular aspirin use may prevent a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers and complement the benefits of screening. Understanding is growing of the possible mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its anticancer effects. "

Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly and macular dystrophy (EEM) are both caused by mutations in the CDH3 gene. Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in two allelic autosomal recessive disorders: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM) syndromes. Distinct CDH3 mutations cause ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome).

Although leptin is produced mainly by white adipose tissue, several laboratories have shown low levels of leptin production by a growing number of tissues including the anterior pituitary gland. Lipolysis (stimulated by beta-adrenergic agents) and leptin secretion by adipocytes are down-regulated by neurons in coculture, effects apparently mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY). Co-localization for leptin, leptin receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the same cell type suggested a functional relationship between glucocorticoid hormone and leptin secretion also at the level of the salivary glands. Leptin was also detected in some microglobules in whole saliva obtained from four healthy volunteers. "

It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a β-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. We demonstrate LARVA\u0027s effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org). "

We have characterized the Plasmodium falciparum minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM) that plays a key role in the transition of pre-RC to the RC. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1. Similar to other eukaryotes, the Plasmodium genome encodes six MCM subunits. The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. "

Selenium supplementation of 140 or more μg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. Vitamins and supplements, including selenium or vitamin E, have not been proven in clinical trials to prevent prostate cancer and in the case of Vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of incident prostate cancer. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status, dose and safety in health assessment and future study design.

Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant containing sinapultide, a bioengineered peptide mimic of surfactant-associated protein B. A meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrates that lucinactant is as effective as animal-derived surfactants in preventing RDS in premature neonates, and in vitro studies suggest it is more resistant to oxidative and protein-induced inactivation. The clinical trials that have been performed, although underpowered, may indicate that lucinactant is superior to phospholipid synthetic surfactant preparations and at least as effective as animal-derived surfactants in reducing morbidity and mortality from RDS. We evaluated whether intratracheal lucinactant, a synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant, was safe and well-tolerated in infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and assessed its effects on clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that early intervention with lucinactant may more effectively mitigate pulmonary pathophysiological sequelae of RDS than the animal-derived surfactants poractant alfa or beractant. An improvement in oxygenation and a significantly reduced requirement for retreatment suggests that lucinactant might improve lung function in infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. "

      "ideal_answer": "Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (\u003c1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has only a minor role in this process.

      "ideal_answer": "Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. In addition, recent data indicate that engineered human L1s can undergo somatic retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells and that an increase in human-specific L1 DNA content can be detected in the brains of normal controls, as well as in Rett syndrome patients. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Recent studies indicate that long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) are mobilized in the genome of human neural progenitor cells and enhanced in Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia. Furthermore, some neurological diseases, such as Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, misregulate L1 retrotransposition, which could contribute to some pathological aspects. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders. "

Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. We previously demonstrated that the mutations Met1Val (M1V) and the deletion of nucleotides 1484-1490 (1484-1490del) in Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) cause the novel disorder autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), which is associated with elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). Microsatellite analysis was performed to confirm monozygosity and bi-parental inheritance of the X chromosome. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively. Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait. Somatic and germline mosaicism for a mutation of the PHEX gene can lead to genetic transmission of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets that mimics an autosomal dominant trait. "

Due to the largely incurable nature of multiple myeloma, the development of newer agents is ongoing and includes new oral PIs (ixazomib), immunotherapies (e.g., CD38- or SLAMF7-targeted antibodies), and small molecules. In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively. Since the introduction of bortezomib in 2003, several next-generation proteasome inhibitors have also been used clinically, including carfilzomib, oprozomib, ixazomib, and delanzomib. Ixazomib (MLN9708-MLN2238), the second-generation proteasome inhibitor, selectivity and potency were similar to that of bortezomib, is currently being investigated in phase I studies. "

Concurrent with evidence of an immune-activation gene signature in MTX-naive RA patients, significant up-regulation of the folate-metabolizing enzymes γ-glutamyl hydrolase and dihydrofolate reductase, as well as the MTX/folate efflux transporters ABCC2 and ABCC5, was observed in the MTX-naive RA group compared to healthy controls. A CD4 T cell gene signature for early rheumatoid arthritis implicates interleukin 6-mediated STAT3 signalling, particularly in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody-negative disease. Flow cytometry and gene profiling indicated that RA-SF macrophages express pro-inflammatory polarization markers (MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2), lack expression of markers associated with homeostatic and anti-inflammatory polarization (IGF1, HTR2B) and exhibit a transcriptomic profile that resembles the activin A-dependent gene signature of pro-inflammatory in vitro-generated macrophages.

However, statins have low efficiency because they also increase PCSK9 which targets LDLR for degradation. Taken together, these results suggested that the IgG1-PA4 can be served as a potential candidate for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting PCSK9-mediated degradation of cell surface LDLRs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which involves in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism by interacting with the LDL receptor, is considered as a potent therapeutic target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface. The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma.

We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome. For the human genome, Burrows-Wheeler indexing allows Bowtie to align more than 25 million reads per CPU hour with a memory footprint of approximately 1.3 gigabytes. "

Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-∕-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. "

      "ideal_answer": "The role of the MCM2-7 helicase complex during Arabidopsis seed development. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing. MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. Activation of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, requires phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase or DDK), which, in turn, depends on prior phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by an unknown kinase (or kinases). During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. After forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) with other components, the MCM2-7 complex is activated by DDK/cyclin-dependent kinase to initiate DNA replication. The MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex, a ring-shaped heterohexamer, unwinds the DNA double helix ahead of the other replication machinery. The quaternary structure of MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC formation. "

This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy. It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors. The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma).

      "ideal_answer": "In this work, we show how to reduce the memory required by the data structure of Chikhi and Rizk (WABI\u002712) that represents de Brujin graphs using Bloom filters. Further, we note that Bloom filters would be suitable to implicitly store spaced seeds and be tolerant to sequencing errors. In contrast to reference-based methods that first align reads to the genome, we hash all reads into Bloom filters to encode, and decode by querying the same Bloom filters using read-length subsequences of the reference genome. We consider several variants of such k-mer Bloom filters (kBFs), derive theoretical upper bounds for their FPR, and discuss their range of applications and limitations. BFs reduce the memory footprint required to store millions of k-mers while allowing for fast set containment queries, at the cost of a low false positive rate (FPR). It uses a pair of cache oblivious Bloom filters, one holding a uniform sample of [Formula: see text]-spaced sequenced [Formula: see text]-mers and the other holding [Formula: see text]-mers classified as likely correct, using a simple statistical test. Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. "

      "ideal_answer": "long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have mainly been studied using cultured cell lines, and this approach has revealed the involvement of lncRNAs in a variety of biological processes, including the epigenetic control of gene expression, post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, and cellular proliferation and differentiation. Many thousands of noncoding RNAs are transcribed and recognized as functional RNAs with diverse sizes, structures, and biological functions. The complex signaling cascades that occur following microbial infection have been studied intensely for a number of years and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) represent novel regulatory components of these pathways. Over the last decade, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a fundamental molecular class whose members play pivotal roles in the regulation of the genome. Protection against infection and maintenance of homeostasis are the hallmarks of the innate immune system. "

      "ideal_answer": "RECENT FINDINGS: Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity. These include combinations (at low dose) of existing drugs, e.g., bupropion + naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine + topiramate (Qsymia), higher doses of existing drugs licensed for other indications (liraglutide, 3 mg), and new entities (lorcaserin). OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements. The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. "

In those that involved doses of 30 mg twice daily, a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving apremilast (28.8% to 40.9%) compared with placebo (5.3% to 5.8%) achieved at least 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score at 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis at week 16; sustained improvements were seen with continued treatment through 52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast has a novel mechanism of action and is safe and effective for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast: A Novel Drug for Treatment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. At this time, apremilast should be reserved for patients unable to take disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. "

      "ideal_answer": "This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment. Sonidegib (Odomzo®), an oral smoothened (SMO) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy, or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy. Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib. The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC. The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy. Oral Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Taladegib have shown to be effective in several trials. "
