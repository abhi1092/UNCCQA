Severe pulmonary toxicity after azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine initiation for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. 17 of 40 (43%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving sulfasalazine had evidence of hemolysis as detected by starch gel electrophoresis. Hemolysis is not a rare side-effect of sulfasalazine therapy. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia as a side effect of azathioprine in a patient with Crohn\u0027s disease. Analysis of the liver histology was highly suggestive of an azathioprine-related, nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Pancreatitis in a patient with Crohn disease treated with mesalazine and azathioprine. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are observed mostly as a side effect of therapy, particularly with use of immunosuppressive drugs. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis induced in a patient treated with infliximab for Crohn\u0027s disease. Persistent corneal endothelial deposits associated with rifabutin therapy for Crohn\u0027s disease. 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) known to be associated with CD treatment (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), serious infections, and lymphoma). Interstitial nephritis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine. Pericarditis as a side effect induced by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid. "

MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly over-expressed in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC, but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared to non-IBD controls (p\u003c0.001). We showed here that among several hundred miRNAs, miR-21 was the only one that increased 6 folds in high-LET IR-promoted mouse liver tumors when compared with that in the non-irradiated liver tissues. As demonstrated in Figure 3A, the five miRNAs (mir-21, mir-223, mir-224, mir-29A and mir-29B) were significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues, except for mir-27a due to non-efficient amplification (CT value in most of the samples was either higher than 35 or even cannot be defined). We also showed that miR-21 was up-regulated in human or mouse hepatocytes after exposure to IR, as well as in liver tissues derived from whole body irradiated mice. "

      "ideal_answer": "Tri-methylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with transcriptionally active genes, but its function in the transcription process is still unclear. Trimethylation of histone H3 Lys 4 (H3K4me3) is a mark of active and poised promoters. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is well known to occur in the promoter region of genes for transcription activation. Furthermore, 3\u0027-H3K4me3 modification levels correlate positively with the antisense expression levels of the associated sense genes, implying that 3\u0027-H3K4me3 is involved in the activation of antisense transcription. Among these are forms of histone 3 that are mono- or tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3, respectively), which bind preferentially to promoter and enhancer elements in the mammalian genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. indicated that H3K4me1, but not H3K4me3, was enriched around distal cis-elements for the E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), while both modifications were enriched at promoters. However, the catalytic function is critically required for transcription as H3K4me3 levels determine the efficiency of transcription elongation. In particular, tri-methyl H3K4 (H3K4me3) occurs at the transcription-start site (TSS) of active genes and is important for transcription activation. "

Swallowing of amniotic fluid after intraamniotic bleeding seems implicated in the etiology of second-trimester echogenic bowel in both euploid and aneuploid fetuses. Fetal echogenic bowel and a dilated loop of bowel associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations delta F508 and 2183AA--\u003eG. Fetal echogenic bowel has been reported as a normal variant in the second trimester, and has also been associated with an adverse fetal outcome, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Primary outcomes were IUGR, defined as birth weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age and intrauterine fetal demise at 20 weeks or more of gestatio. The presence of echogenic bowel on ultrasonography is independently associated with an increased risk for both IUGR and intrauterine fetal demise. "

      "ideal_answer": "It has been envisaged that CpG islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these sequences. CpG islands are preferentially located at the start of transcription of housekeeping genes and are associated with tissue-specific genes. CpG islands are stretches of DNA sequence that are enriched in the (CpG)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. In housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called CpG island. our analysis indicates that the association of CGIs with housekeeping genes is not as strong as previously estimated. Unmethylated CpG rich islands are a feature of vertebrate DNA: they are associated with housekeeping and many tissue specific genes. "

      "ideal_answer": "yeast origins are characterized by an asymmetric pattern of positioned nucleosomes flanking the ACS. we demonstrate that open chromatin domains, characterized by nucleosome depletion, are preferentially permissive for replication. The origin sequences are sufficient to maintain a nucleosome-free origin; however, ORC is required for the precise positioning of nucleosomes flanking the origin. ORC binds to Nucleosome free regions (NFRs) in both budding yeast and Drosophila (1,37,38), suggesting that nucleosome organization may be a defining feature of origins in all eukaryotes. Together, our results demonstrate significant enrichment of pre-RC proteins at regions of generally low nucleosome occupancy that are found within a de-localized region of initiation. Here, we identify nucleosome occupancy as a likely candidate to set up ORI distribution. Replication of chromosomes was severely inhibited at more than two-thirds of physiological nucleosome density. the presence of a well-positioned nucleosome adjacent to the origin NFR was shown to be essential for ORC to nucleate pre-RC assembly and for origin activity. Nucleosome assembly of the template prevented DNA replication. "

In this study we investigated whether in an animal model for MS, namely in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), similar changes occur. EAE is the best available model for the inflammatory processes that occur in MS, and for the disease process. To assess neurological impairments quantitatively in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), we have used a targeted model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Therefore, a well characterized homogeneous animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), was selected for this study to obtain a sample of the inflammatory lesions. an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS): disease modifying activity on acute and chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-studied disease in rodents that mimics many clinical and pathological features of MS, including central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. Both multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), its animal model, involve inflammatory attack on central nervous system (CNS) white matter. inflammatory demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

Mutations in five genes (FGFR1-, -2, -3, TWIST, and MSX2) causing craniosynostosis as the main clinical feature were described. SOX6 mutation screening of another 104 craniosynostosis patients revealed one missense mutation leading to the exchange of a highly conserved amino acid (p.D68N) in a single patient and his reportedly healthy mother. Recently, the substitution of proline 250 by arginine in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, has been identified in patients with craniosynostosis and defines a new syndrome on a molecular basis. Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR1, -2 and -3) and TWIST genes have been identified in several syndromic forms of craniosynostosis. Most mutations in Crouzon, Pfeiffer, and Apert syndromes are in the extracellular, third immunoglobulin-like domain and adjacent linker regions (exons IIIa and IIIc) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene. We found previously that a single amino acid substitution in the homeodomain of the human MSX2 gene is associated with the autosomal dominant disorder craniosynostosis, Boston type. "

Cysts in the kidney are among the most common inherited human pathologies, and recent research has uncovered that a defect in cilia-mediated signaling activity is a key factor that leads to cyst formation. Recent research has focused on defects in signaling mediated by the primary cilia as the causative factor in ADPKD. Interestingly, primary cilia concentrate p75NTR receptors in their membranes and are abnormally structured/damaged in transgenic (Tg) AD‑model mice, which could impact on the adult neurogenesis occurring in the dentate gyrus\u0027s subgranular zone (SGZ) that is necessary for new memory encoding, thereby favouring typical AD cognitive decline. In cultured renal cells, the PKHD1 gene product colocalized with polycystin-2, the gene product of autosomal dominant polycystic disease type 2, at the basal bodies of primary cilia. Although Glis3(zf/zf) mice form normal primary cilia, renal cysts contain relatively fewer cells with a primary cilium. Here, we report that CP110 interacts with CEP290--a protein whose deficiency is implicated in human ciliary disease. "

A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98. The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening policies of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Jewish population. However, our data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants). The allelic frequency of this variant was calculated to be 0.7% for this population. CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals. "

To evaluate a putative implication of three newly identified expansin/family 45 endoglucanase-like (EEL) proteins in lignocellulose degradation. these wall-loosening proteins are directly involved in the accommodation of the fungus by infected cortical cells. alpha-Expansins are extracellular proteins that increase plant cell-wall extensibility. cell wall swelling may not be a significant event during the action of expansin and hydrolases. Our results show that EglD is a conidial cell wall localized expansin-like protein, which could be involved in cell wall remodeling during germination. interactions with alpha-expansin in cell wall extension and polysaccharide degradation.

NF-κB inhibition causes cellular reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis under basal conditions and induces necrosis on glucose starvation. loss of the widely expressed transcription factor Oct1 induces a coordinated metabolic shift: mitochondrial activity and amino acid oxidation are increased, while glucose metabolism is reduced. c-Myc regulates genes involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes and mitochondria, and regulation of glucose and glutamine metabolism. the inhibition of PDK4 expression by NF-κB is related to the shift towards increased glycolysis that is observed during cardiac pathological processes induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

      "ideal_answer": "In the meantime, there has been a great interest with scientific communities in text mining tools to find knowledge such as protein-protein interactions, which is most relevant and useful for specific analysis tasks. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm by a frame-based approach for a web-based tool, PPI Finder, which can not only find the related genes of the gene of interest based on their co-occurrence frequencies but also extract the semantic descriptions of interactions from the co-occurring literature by computational linguistic methods. Plenty of PPI text mining approaches have been categorized into two groups, one is statistical calculation of the co-occurrence of genes or proteins, and the other is the computational linguistic method [2], [4]. In contrast, GeneView recognizes a broader set of entity types but not gene ontology terms, provides search facilities using unique database identifiers and also finds relationships between proteins in texts. For the purposes of this paper and the initial population of the BIND database, we have chosen to focus on extracting information from the literature that is sufficient for defining a simple protein-protein interaction record in BIND.

For the reasons mentioned above, there is clearly a need to develop computational tools for predicting the membrane spanning strands of those proteins, and also discriminating them from water-soluble proteins when searching entire genomes. On the basis of existing knowledge of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins, several state of the art prediction methods, as well as a new in-house program (PROB) were employed for the systematic exploration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes for potential beta-barrel structures. These methods are based grossly on hydrophobicity (10) and statistical analysis (11,12), remote homology detection (13), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (14–18), feed-forward Neural Networks (19–21), radial basis function Neural Networks (22,23) and Support Vector Machines (24), whereas others like BOMP (25), TMB-Hunt (26,27) and the TMB-finding pipeline (28) are oriented towards genome scale discrimination of β-barrel membrane proteins.

The autoantibodies implicated in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES), which are known to inhibit ICa and INa in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, also significantly inhibited INa in SCLC cells. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may be important to the secretion of ectopic hormones and the etiology and pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of the motor nerve terminal in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are produced. These results indicate that (i) action potentials in human SCLC cells result from the regenerative increase in voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance; (ii) fundamental characteristics of SCLC Na+ channels are the same as the classical sodium channels found in a variety of excitable cells; and (iii) in some LES patients, SCLC Na+ channels are an additional target of the pathological IgG present in the patients\u0027 sera. In the majority of LEMS patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells.

Human galactocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Krabbe disease, was purified, through several hydrophobic column steps and gel filtration, 22,650-fold from human lymphocytes. The lack of complementation between Krabbe disease patient and twitcher mutant mouse cells provides further evidence that the twitcher mouse is an authentic murine model for Krabbe disease and supports the hypothesis that the mutations in both species are within the structural gene for the galactocerebrosidase enzyme. This mouse has deficient activity of GALC (beta-galactosylceramidase) that leads to a progressive accumulation of some galactosyl-sphingolipids in the brain. This chapter describes in detail a practical procedure for the preparation of radiolabeled galactocerebroside and its use in the assay of galactocerebrosidase (GalCase), the enzyme deficient in globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease). Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by the pathogenomic accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), a substrate for the deficient enzyme galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase.

A recent American Heart Association (AHA) Prevention Committee report recommended depression screening of all coronary heart disease patients using 2- and 9-item instruments from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) to identify patients who may need further assessment and treatment. The American Heart Association (AHA) statement has recommended routine screening for depression in coronary artery disease with a 2-stage implementation of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Patients were screened for depression using a protocol identical to the one endorsed by the AHA in a cardiology community clinic in Elmhurst (Queens, New York). METHODS: Staff nurses in an urban cardiac care unit administered versions 2, 9, and 10 of the questionnaire to 100 patients with acute coronary syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nurse-administered versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression screening in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome. Depression screening in cardiac patients has been recommended by the American Heart Association, but the best approach remains unclear. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire.

      "ideal_answer": "Therefore, the therapeutic action of tolcapone in Parkinson\u0027s disease, might be dependent on the reduction of COMT activity in the extracerebral tissue. Entacapone is a highly potent, reversible, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used as an adjunct to L-dopa in the treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Entacapone is able to slow down degradation of levodopa and improve the availability and efficacy of each levodopa dose, hence its use as a complement to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson\u0027s disease. Here we report that a treatment of the cerebral tissue with tolcapone, a central and peripheral inhibitor of COMT, does not change the membrane responses of midbrain dopamine neurons to dopamine and levodopa. The novel and reversible inhibitors are the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitors, Ro 40-7592 (3,4-dihydroxy-4\u0027-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone), and the monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, Ro 19-6327 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-2-pyridine carboxamide HC1). Two inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been introduced as adjuncts to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson\u0027s disease patients. We investigated whether administration of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, alters the pharmacokinetics of apomorphine in Parkinson\u0027s disease patients experiencing severe motor fluctuations.

      "ideal_answer": "Patients with chronic cluster headache may achieve good results from long-term treatment with other therapies, including lithium carbonate, verapamil, and ketoprofen. The objective of this open single-centre study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) as add-on in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache (CH). These findings provide evidence that BTX-A may be beneficial as an add-on prophylactic therapy for a limited number of patients with chronic CH. There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine. Recently, the therapeutic options for refractory CH patients have expanded with the emergence of both peripheral (mostly occipital nerve) and central (hypothalamic) neurostimulation. Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis. Other drugs that may be used for this purpose include lithium carbonate, topiramate, valproic acid, gabapentin, and baclofen. For medically refractory patients, surgical interventions, occipital nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain an option. In some patients, melatonin or topiramate may be useful adjunctive therapies. "

      "ideal_answer": "The recognition of sustained androgen dependence of CRPC has led to the identification of more potent and selective inhibitors of androgen synthesis and androgen-receptor signaling, such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, respectively. Sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic vaccine, is now available in the US for patients with non-metastatic CRPC and abiraterone, an oral enzyme inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, as well as cabazitaxel, a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic, have been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC. This could potentially be explained by the fact that although abiraterone blocks androgen synthesis at the CYP17 level, androgens upstream continue to accumulate and can potentially stimulate an altered androgen receptor. Thus, the original rationale for the use of abiraterone acetate in CRPC is that a complete blockade of not only testicular but also adrenal androgen may beneficial in CRPC patients. Recently, abiraterone acetate, which is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), has been focused on for the treatment of CRPC. This review summarizes the rationale, mechanism of action and relevant clinical data of abiraterone acetate , an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in the management of CRPC. "

In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients\u0027 DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.

      "ideal_answer": "Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm. This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%. A major randomized controlled trial, the British aneurysm oral nimodipine trial, showed a significant reduction in the incidence of cerebral infarction and poor outcome at three months compared to placebo.

Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Clinical Global Impression assessment by professionals, in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, are useful in assessing depression, but none of these instruments clearly stood apart from the others. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS), a diagnostic tool specifically devised to assess depression after stroke, in comparison to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68% depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50% depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists).

      "ideal_answer": "This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke. Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke. Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption.

The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient\u0027s respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Unconscious patients (n \u003d 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P \u003c .01). Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. "

To assess the prevalence of MYOZ2 mutations among European HCM patients. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP\u0027s mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. In this study, we aimed to investigate a possible association between mutations in the Irx4 gene and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. "

A recently explored CYP2C19*17 allelic variant has been linked to increased transcriptional activity, resulting in extensive metabolization of CYP2C19 substrates, which may lead to an enhanced platelet response to clopidogrel treatment. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefit of tailored therapy with a higher maintenance dose according to CYP2C19 genotypes in patients identified as nonresponders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.

If antidepressants are used to treat insomnia, sedating ones should be preferred over activating agents such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In 26 patients with FMS who completed a 6-week open study with mirtazapine, 10 (38%) responded with a reduction of at least 40% of the initial levels of pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances (Samborski et al 2004). In the indication of insomnia, most of the time, trazodone (90.5 %) or mirtazapine (5.4 %) were used, and in lower dosages than those required for depression treatment (\u003cMED). Regarding the lack of substantial data allowing for evidence-based recommendations, we are facing a clear need for well designed, long-term, comparative studies to further define the role of antidepressants versus other agents in the management of insomnia.

      "ideal_answer": "Early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u0027s disease, vascular and frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson\u0027s disease, are frequently associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. The cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. "

We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer\u0027s disease than in controls in the discovery set. In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset ≤65 years and 783 controls. Genetic deficits and loss of function for the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; encoded at chr6p21.1), a transmembrane spanning stimulatory receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like gene superfamily, have been associated with deficiencies in phagocytosis and the innate immune system in Alzheimer\u0027s disease. we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD. Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD),. TREM2 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer\u0027s disease in Spanish population. The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer\u0027s disease (P\u003c0.001). "

      "ideal_answer": "Cocaine use has been temporally associated with neurovascular complications, including the rupture of intracerebral aneurysms. The high frequency of hypertension, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and lacunar infarction among young black patients with stroke suggests accelerated hypertensive arteriolar damage, possibly due to poor control of hypertension. Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). Cocaine use and hypertension are major risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in young African Americans. Chronic cocaine use appears to predispose patients who harbor incidental neurovascular anomalies to present at an earlier point in their natural history than similar non-cocaine users. Although the exact mechanism by which berry aneurysms form remains undetermined, research indicates that propagation and rupture of the aneurysm are aggravated by hypertension and tachycardia, both of which are pharmacologic side effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. Cocaine is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but there are no large studies that have characterized the location, pathology, and outcome of patients with cocaine-associated ICH. "

Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f) current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels. The activity of TR DNA binding to the transcriptional regulatory region in the alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes and the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the heart and plasma 3,3\u0027-triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were altered in association with changes in the myocardial TR protein levels. PKC alpha overexpression in cardiomyocytes caused marked repression of triiodothyronine (T3)-responsive genes, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated adenosinetriphosphatase SERCA2. Treatment with T3 for 4 h resulted in significant reductions of PKC alpha in nuclear and cytosolic compartments, and decreased TR alpha1 mRNA and protein, with normalization of phenotype. lpha-Myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) decreased in DRON while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT.

HCN2 gene expression was not significantly affected by TR beta 1. TR beta 1 exclusively suppressed HCN4 transcription. we identified thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which negatively regulates β-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27a. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. increasing TR expression in the hypertrophied heart is associated with an improvement in contractile function and increased SERCA expression. he TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression. TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1,. Although T3 levels were normal in these animals, this pattern of cardiac gene expression mimics a hypothyroid phenotype. The messenger RNA levels for MHC alpha and SERCA2 were markedly down-regulated, MHC beta messenger RNA was up-regulated. "

The emerging picture is one in which Oct4 and Nanog control a cascade of pathways that are intricately connected to govern pluripotency, self-renewal, genome surveillance and cell fate determination. Nanog is a stem cell transcription factor required for self-renewal and for maintaining pluripotency. Not surprisingly, transfection of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 in human fibroblasts induces pluripotency, suggesting an important role for each of these factors in reprogramming the genome of somatic cells. our results demonstrate that NANOG, a cell-fate regulatory molecule known to be important for ESC self-renewal, also plays a novel role in tumor development. the effect of FAK and Nanog cross-regulation on cancer cell morphology, invasion, and growth that plays a significant role in carcinogenesis. establishes a role for Nanog-like in regulating the formation of the extraembryonic tissue required for endoderm induction. Nanog, a key transcription factor in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. In mammalian embryonic stem cells, the acquisition of pluripotency is dependent on Nanog. Elevated expression of Nanog has also been reported to result in clonal expansion of murine ESCs. "

      "ideal_answer": "We recommend initial dosage regimens consisting of a loading dose of vancomycin of 25 mg/kg followed by doses of 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for infants with weights less than 1,000 gm. Infants weighing over 1,000 gm should receive 10 mg/kg every 12 hours, with a loading dose of 12.5 mg/kg. There is significant variation in gentamicin and vancomycin dosing regimens and TDM guidance across a UK network of neonatal units. Infants weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. Recommended vancomycin schedules for term newborn infants with neonatal sepsis should be based on the weight and postconceptual age only to start antimicrobial therapy. Staphylococcus epidermis, including methicillin-resistant strains, are inhibited by vancomycin concentrations of 1-4 µg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the proposed schedule leads to adequate vancomycin trough serum concentrations, and there is no need for routine monitoring of peak serum concentrations. The model that best fitted the data included clearance and volume per kilogram and was independent of gestational age. "

      "ideal_answer": "Propofol is the sedative most frequently used for short-term sedation and the weaning phase, whereas benzodiazepines are the preferred substances for medium- and long-term sedation. The majority of practitioners (82%) use propofol infusion in children in PICU, the main indication being for short-term sedation in children requiring procedures. The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable. Propofol, despite its attractive pharmacological profile, may offer no clinical benefit in short-term sedation after a moderate dose fentanyl anaesthesia in cardiac surgery. Midazolam and propofol were compared in an open randomized study for postoperative sedation during 12 h of mechanical ventilation in 40 patients following coronary artery bypass grafting. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and endocrine response of propofol vs. the new alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine for sedation in surgical intensive care patients who need postoperative short-term ventilation. Twenty patients who were expected to require 8 h of post-operative sedation and ventilation were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-2.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) or propofol 1-3 mg kg(-1) h(-1).

      "ideal_answer": "After Ethics Review Board approval, 44 ASA I-III patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery were randomised after surgery to either hypercapnic hyperpnoea or control groups. Hypercapnic hyperpnoea in spontaneously breathing patients halves the time of recovery from sevoflurane-induced anaesthesia in the operating room. After obtaining institutional board approval (IRB), each centre will recruit and randomly assign (with a computerized randomization procedure) patients to one of three treatment arms to receive desflurane, sevoflurane or propofol for anaesthesia maintenance. A randomised controlled trial of paediatric conscious sedation for dental treatment using intravenous midazolam combined with inhaled nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide/sevoflurane. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial (sevoflurane vs. propofol) to compare cardiac troponin release in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery. Comparison of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide mixture with nitrous oxide alone for inhalation conscious sedation in children having dental treatment: a randomised controlled trial. We compared the haemodynamics, emergence and recovery characteristics of total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol/remifentanil with sevoflurane/remifentanil anaesthesia, under bispectral index guidance, in 103 patients undergoing surgical procedures lasting \u003e 3.5 h.

      "ideal_answer": "With poly(dG-dC) as substrate, the reaction proceeds by an equilibrium (or processive) ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which DNA binds to the enzyme first, followed by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Catalytic mechanism of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases revisited: covalent intermediate formation is not essential for methyl group transfer by the murine Dnmt3a enzyme. The mechanism of DNA cytosine-5-methylation catalyzed by the bacterial M.HhaI enzyme has been considered as a stepwise nucleophilic addition of Cys-81-S- to cytosine C6 followed by C5 nucleophilic replacement of the methyl of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to produce 5-methyl-6-Cys-81-S-5,6-dihydrocytosine. Our studies reveal that the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases involves attack of the C6 of substrate cytosines by an enzyme nucleophile and formation of a transient covalent adduct. On the basis of amino acid sequence alignments and structural data of related enzymes, we have performed a mutational analysis of 14 amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA-(cytosine C5)-methyltransferase. D96A (motif III) showed reduced AdoMet binding but increased activity under conditions of saturation with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), indicating that the contact of Asp96 to AdoMet is not required for catalysis.

Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years. To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic pain. Dying children with cancer and neuropathic pain have higher baseline requirements of morphine and benzodiazepines and require rapid increases of both drugs in the last 72 hours of life than dying children without neuropathic pain. Treatment was typically initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, and 5 of the 6 girls noted improvement in their symptoms, including 2 who had marked improvement, and another 3 with substantial improvement who were able to discontinue therapy without a recurrence.

CRUCIAL was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, open-label, parallel design, cluster-randomized trial conducted in 19 countries in four geographical regions, including Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America, between March 2007 and October 2009 (Figure 1). IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy (IMPACT) is an open-label randomised controlled trial comparing a once-daily polypill containing four preventive medications with usual care. The Caduet Adherence Research Program and Education (CARPE) retrospective cohort studies were designed to evaluate potential adherence benefits of SPAA vs co-administered antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy in real-world settings (Table 1).The first of these studies, CARPE-Patient Benefits Management (CARPE-PBM), was a retrospective database study of pharmacy claims data that identified patients who were newly initiated on SPAA, or a CCB or statin. various pilot studies and Phase II trials of other single-pill combinations of antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medications, and aspirin (eg, the Polycap, which contains low doses of thiazide, atenolol, ramipril, simvastatin, and aspirin) have been completed and published.

At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, compared with 1/5 in AS-Control. METHODS: Twelve adolescents (mean age \u003d 15.6 years) with anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to CBT (n \u003d 6) or a group attention-support control condition. This trial will be one of the first to assess the use of an internet-based CBT program in the treatment of GAD, and to date, the first to compare it with a gold standard pharmacological treatment. Clinician ratings of impairment and self-report levels of overall anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control. Clinically referred children (aged 8 to 12) diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder (n \u003d 52), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (n \u003d 37), Social Phobia (n \u003d 22) or Specific Phobia (n \u003d 16) were randomly assigned to individual (n \u003d 65) or group (n \u003d 62) treatment.

The building blocks of the cortex are trichocyte keratins intermediate filaments (IFs) with a 7.5 nm diameter embedded in a sulfur-rich protein matrix and arranged in a paracrystalline hexagonal lattice [4]. Further, using cryo-transmission electron microscopy on native, fully hydrated, vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists, both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes, of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately 8 nm. They are assembled from three distinct molecular mass proteins that bind to each other to form a 10-nm-diameter filamentous rod with sidearm extensions. ntroductionIntermediate filaments are a diverse family of cytoskeletal proteins that assemble into 10 nm diameter filaments in cells[1]. After removing IFs by calcination, electron microscopy revealed hollow silica nanotubes several micrometers long, with outer diameters of 35-55 nm and an average inner diameter of 10 nm (comparable to that of IFs).

This case, and limited literature data, suggest that gabapentin may cause rash that is severe enough to necessitate discontinuation in a small percentage of children. Twenty-six children with intellectual disability and six normal children, all suffering from refractory partial seizures, received open-label gabapentin (range \u003d 10-50 mg kg(-1) day(-1); mean \u003d 26.7 mg kg(-1) day(-1) as an add-on medication to their antiepileptic drug regimen. The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The efficacy and safety of gabapentin as add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures in 237 children, aged 3 to 12 years were evaluated over a 6-month period. We described 3 learning disabled children, 1 aged 7 and 2 aged 10 years, with intractable partial seizures who developed severe behavioral problems while receiving modest doses of GBP. "

      "ideal_answer": "We had previously shown that in anergic CD4(+) T cells, Ikaros participates in the transcriptional repression of the Il2 gene by recruiting histone deacetylases that cause core histone deacetylation at the Il2 promoter. Here we show that deacetylation at the Il2 promoter is the initial step in a process that leads to the stable silencing of the Il2 gene transcription in anergic T cells. The histone deacetylase HDA6 deacetylates lysines of core histones including H3 and H4, and is required for cytosine methylation in transgenes and silenced rRNA genes [11]–[13]. Because DNA hypermethylation-based silencing may couple with and depend on histone deacetylation, our study suggests that endogenous HDAC inhibition by maspin may prevent pathologic gene silencing in prostate tumor progression. Belinostat alone has no effect on MLH1 expression and this is consistent with the observation that histone deacetylase inhibitors cannot induce the expression of genes silenced due to promoter methylation (Suzuki et al, 2002).

      "ideal_answer": "Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term or late preterm infants. Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 15 preterm infants who were referred for surgical intervention of advanced NEC and failure of at least 3 organs. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a randomized trial. Additional investigation of the efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in this population is warranted. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) whole-body hypothermia trial9, demonstrated a 28% relative reduction in death or moderate or severe disability at 18 to 22 months in hypothermia-treated infants compared with control infants. Although how hypothermia confers neuroprotection is not fully understood, hypothermia reduces cerebral metabolism, inhibits glutamate release, preserves high energy phosphates, reduces neuronal nitric oxide production, preserves endogenous antioxidants, and ameliorates apoptotic neuronal death in experimental models. Little is known about applications of this treatment to preterm newborns. "

This study provides preliminary evidence that BMI may be an important prognostic factor in response to metformin for women with ovulation dysfunction related to polycystic ovary syndrome, suggesting that women with a lower BMI may respond better to metformin treatment versus placebo amongst women with BMI\u003e32 kg/m(2). This study aimed to ascertain factors that predict fertility success with treatment that included metformin compared to standard (non-metformin) treatment. Our conclusion is that Metformin is an effective addition to Clomifene Citrate in term of reestablishment of ovulation and full-term pregnancies achievement, excluding ART cycles. investigate the effect of pre-treatment with metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) scheduled for IVF stimulation. Pre-treatment with metformin prior to conventional IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS does not improve stimulation or clinical outcome. Treatment of 10 insulin-resistant PCOS women with metformin significantly increased circulating fasting ghrelin concentrations. "

The INSURE method, which consists of an intubation-surfactant-extubation sequence, is effective in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), the duration of respiratory support, and the need for surfactant replacement in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant given during brief intubation followed by immediate extubation on nasal continuous positive airway pressure [Intubation-Surfactant-Extubation (InSurE) approach] is used to treat respiratory distress syndrome in newborns. Our aim was to identify the clinical characteristics which could distinguish infants who can be managed with INSURE (intubatio-surfactant-extubation) method for preventing mechanical ventilation (MV) and which could predict INSURE success or failure. Our aim was to evaluate whether single and multiple intubation-surfactant-extubation (INSURE) procedures have similar effects on the need of mechanical ventilation (MV) and occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely preterm infants.

      "ideal_answer": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Aft1 is activated in iron-deficient cells to induce the expression of iron regulon genes, which coordinate the increase of iron uptake and remodel cellular metabolism to survive low-iron conditions. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft1, has a well established role in regulating iron homeostasis through the transcriptional induction of iron-regulon genes. Using a scheme for selecting mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with abnormalities of iron metabolism, we have identified a gene, AFT1, that mediates the control of iron uptake. Iron deprivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces transcription of genes required for high-affinity iron uptake. The AFT1 transcriptional factor is differentially required for expression of high-affinity iron uptake genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aft1 displays phosphorylation modifications depending on the growth stage of the cells, and it might link induction of genes for iron uptake to other metabolically dominant requirement for cell growth. In contrast, through both directed studies and microarray transcriptional profiling, we show that the role of Aft1 in chromosome maintenance and benomyl resistance is independent of its iron regulatory role, potentially through a nontranscriptional mechanism.

To clarify the regulatory potential of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by miRNAs of PK and PD genes. Our analysis identify a striking difference in the level of miRNA regulation between PK and PD genes, with the former having less than half predicted conserved miRNA binding sites compared with the latter. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. n silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. The potential modulation of toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted.

      "ideal_answer": "Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain. In mammals, the members of this family all contain a conserved Mg++-dependent nuclease domain similar to that found in yeast Ccr4p and typified by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) family of proteins [11], but only two of the members of this family (called “Ccr4a” and “Ccr4b” in humans) have N-terminal extensions that contain leucine-rich repeats like those necessary for the Caf1p/Pop2p interaction in yeast. The evolutionarily conserved CCR4 protein, which is part of the cytoplasmic deadenylase, contains a C-terminal domain that displays homology to an Mg2+-dependent DNase/phosphatase family of proteins. This group comprises enzymes active on both DNA and RNA, and includes the CCR4, Nocturnin and ANGEL proteins.Here we show that human 2′-PDE, unlike other components constituting the 2–5A system (24–29), is located in the mitochondrial matrix compartment, and comprises a general 3′–5′ exoribonuclease exhibiting a preference for oligo-adenosine RNA like canonical cytoplasmic deadenylases (21,22,30–33).

      "ideal_answer": "Cytosine methyltransferases as tumor markers. Moreover, we show that miR-29b targets DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNAs and reduces global DNA methylation in MM cells. The aberrant CpG methylation patterns in human cancer cells are inscribed by the de novo DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and transmitted in the subsequent cell generations by the maintenance DNMT1 [4, 6]. A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed. Taking into account the low intrinsic de novo methyltransferase ability of DNMT1 cases [6, 77], this protein may also be capable of initiating aberrant CpG island methylation patterns, replacing the conventional de novo DNMT3s, at least in cancer cells. The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development. In the current paper, a comprehensive review of CpG methylation, DNA methyltransferases and cancer is presented. "

      "ideal_answer": "In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. Densely ionizing radiation induces complex damage consisting of different types of DNA lesions in close proximity that are difficult to repair and may promote carcinogenesis. The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. "

It is suggested that BOR has therapeutic efficacy for multiple myeloma as a first-line medical treatment and/or for patients with THAL resistance, and can improve prognosis and survival. In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, co-administration of rifampicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the exposure to bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular, degenerative and progressive disease, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. Dystrophic myotonia is a sufficiently rare disease inherited mainly by the autosomal dominant type. Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder. DM is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, muscular dystrophy, myotonia, and multisystem involvement. All patients have the DM2 (CCTG)(n) expansion. "

The isotretinoin, a 13-cis-retinoic acid, has revolutionized the management of severe treatment-resistant acne and it has been widely used for a range of dermatological conditions, in 90% of the time in young women between 13 and 45 years of age. Twelve 60-day-old female Mus musculus were divided into two groups on the 7th day of pregnancy: treated group--1 mg isotretinoin per kg body weight, dissolved in vegetable oil, was administered from the 7th to the 13th day of pregnancy; control group--vegetable oil in equivalent volume was administered orally for the same period. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis.

      "ideal_answer": "The inheritance pattern of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is X linked, whereas EDMD2 is autosomal dominant. Recently, mutations in this LMNA gene have been also found to be responsible for the less frequent autosomal recessive form of the disease. Although it has been reported that EDMD caused by the STA gene mutation is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance, the genotype-phenotype correlations, with special reference to cardiac manifestations, are not well defined. EDMD2 is caused by lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations that produce alterations in the lamin proteins that are integral to nuclear and cell integrity. . Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait. The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers. Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles, 2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a humeroperoneal distribution, and 3) life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction block. "

      "ideal_answer": "5-Aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a nucleoside analog that can inhibit DNA cytosine methylation, possesses potent antitumorigenic activities for myeloid disorders. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers. The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism. The therapeutic potential of DNMT1 inhibitors has provided the drive to develop a new assay suitable for the kinetic analysis of cytosine-C5 methyltransferase activity in a format applicable to high-throughput screening. Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI.

Together, these results suggest that BIX-01294 and TM2-115 inhibit malaria parasite histone methyltransferases, resulting in rapid and irreversible parasite death. However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. Two compounds, BIX-01294 and its derivative TM2-115, inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 parasites in culture with IC(50) values of ~100 nM, values at least 22-fold more potent than their apparent IC(50) toward two human cell lines and one mouse cell line. A total of 55 adenosine-containing compounds were designed and synthesized, among which several potent DOT1L inhibitors were identified with K(i) values as low as 0.5 nM. We synthesized a compound library based upon a known specific inhibitor (BIX-01294) of the human G9a histone methyltransferase. The results demonstrate that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies.

      "ideal_answer": "Survivin expression is turned off during fetal development and not found in non-neoplastic adult human tissues but is again turned on in the most common human cancers. Aggressive (Group 2) melanomas were characterized by upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression, DNA replication and repair, and altered expression of apoptosis-related genes including upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC5/survivin [49] and downregulation of the novel stress-associated apoptosis inducer TRIB3 [50] (Table 1). Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in most terminally differentiated normal human tissues, strongly expressed in embryonic and fetal organs and is strongly expressed in many different human cancers. Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors.

Cryptochrome 1 and 2 gene products act in the negative feedback loop and are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel running behaviour and absence of cyclic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mice in constant darkness. Mammalian circadian clocks are based on a transcription and translation feedback loop in which a heterodimer of the transcription factors circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) drives transcription from E-box elements, including that of their own repressors, the Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes2. We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland. Consistent with their central role in circadian rhythm generation, genetic inactivation of both cryptochromes (cry1,2-/-) results in circadian arrhythmicity in mice [22,23]. "

We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Plasma glucose concentration of the fetal hypothyroid group during intravenous glucose tolerance test was significantly higher (p\u003d0.003) at 5-20 min as compared to the control group, whereas plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower (p\u003d0.012). Although adult offspring born from hypothyroid mothers were euthyroid, their glucose tolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion of islets were altered. "

MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. Through a bioinformatics screening using TargetScan, we identified thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which negatively regulates β-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27a. hese findings suggested that miR-27a regulates β-MHC gene expression by targeting TRβ1 in cardiomyocytes.

      "ideal_answer": "Occurring exclusively at cytosine within CpG dinucleotides in mammals, DNA methylation is coordinated by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)5 comprising DNMT1, -3A, -3B, and -3L. .There are three enzymes in the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase (DNMT) family: DNMT1, DNMT 3 alpha (DNMT3A), and DNMT 3 beta (DNMT3B). This promoter hypermethylation may be mediated not only by DNMT-1 but also by an entire family of de novo DNA-methyltransferases, such as DNA-methyltransferase-3a (DNMT-3a) and -3b (DNMT-3b). The DNMT3B de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) plays a major role in establishing DNA methylation patterns in early mammalian development, but its catalytic mechanism remains poorly characterized. The Dnmt2 proteins contain all the sequence motifs characteristic for DNA-(cytosine C5)-MTases and the Dnmt2 structure strongly resemble prokaryotic DNA MTases [14], [15], but in contrast to all other mammalian DNA MTases, Dnmt2 does not possess a large N-terminal regulatory domain. In the traditional model at least two different families of MTases were proposed to exist in eukaryotes: one family that is required for de novo methylation of DNA targeting un-methylated DNA, while the other family is specific for hemi-methylated DNA copying the methylation pattern in every replication cycle [2], [12].

      "ideal_answer": "Hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1),. Amiodarone resulted in increased T4, T4/T3 and rT3, whereas dronedarone did not alter the thyroid hormone profile in normal animals. Administration of debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a TRα1 antagonist abolished the T3-limiting effect on reperfusion injury:. dronedarone treatment results in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism. The in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that dronedarone via its metabolite debutyldronedarone acts as a TRalpha(1)-selective inhibitor. Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50%. In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased TRbeta 1. "

      "ideal_answer": "The results indicate that ranolazine, at concentrations which have significantly beneficial effects during ischaemic episodes, only greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation. Ranolazine may provide functional protection of the heart during IR injury by reducing cCa2+ and mCa2+ loading secondary to its effect to block the late Na+ current. Ranolazine, a late I(Na) inhibitor, has been shown to provide both anti-anginal and anti-ischemic benefits without significant alterations in the heart rate and blood pressure in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Ranolazine and lidocaine (10 μM) similarly reduced Ca2+i overload and improved left ventricle work recovery in whole-heart models of IR injury or exposure to ouabain (80 μM). Ranolazine is a selective inhibitor of the late sodium current relative to peak sodium channel current, and via this mechanism, it may decrease sodium-dependent intracellular calcium overload during ischemia and reperfusion. Ranolazine selectively inhibits late I(Na), reduces [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarisation and contractility that are associated with ischaemia/reperfusion and heart failure. he beneficial effects of ranolazine in reducing Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion is consistent with the inhibition of late INa mechanism of action.

      "ideal_answer": "the results demonstrated that TMZ is cardioprotective when administered before reperfusion and that this protection appears to be mediated by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling. The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. TMZ induced cardioprotection did not involve p38 MAPK and JNKs. Phospho-p38 MAPK and JNKs levels after I/R were not changed with TMZ treatment. Activation of AMPK and decreased expression of PGC-1 alpha were involved in this process. The study emphasizes the importance of administering TMZ before reflow to prevent reperfusion-mediated cardiac injury and dysfunction. "

      "ideal_answer": "diabetes leads to cardiomyopathy in later stages with hypocontractility and reduced SERCA activity. Although decreased SR Ca2+ uptake exists, it is offset by an increase in action-potential duration, thereby ensuring that SR Ca2+ content is maintained. diabetic cardiomyocytes displayed reduced SERCA activity and Ca2+ sequestration, as well as impaired NCX function. Treatment with breviscapine could reverse the cardiac dysfunction and structure changes in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats, and decrease the expression of PKC and PLB, as well as increase the expression of PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR. Diabetic Ren-2 rats developed impairment of both active and passive phases of diastole, accompanied by reductions in SERCA-2a ATPase and phospholamban along with activation of the fetal gene program. Previous studies with diabetes type 1 models have shown a down-regulation of SERCA2a in the heart associated with a decrease in systolic and diastolic function. Compared with control group, [Ca(2+)](i) and the expression of CaSR, RyR and SERCA/PLN were decreased, while PKC-α and PLN were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in diabetic group. The levels of SERCA and GLUT4, but not PLB, were significantly reduced in diabetic hearts compared with controls. Diabetic rats showed impaired cardiac structure and function compared with control rats. "

Previously we had shown the synergic effect of bortezomib and thiostrepton in breast cancer cells in vitro, where sub-apoptotic concentrations of both proteasome inhibitors resulted in synergic increase in cell death when combined as a treatment. Preclinical studies currently being conducted by the National Cancer Institute against a panel of 60 cell lines show that BU-32 has broad anti-tumor activity (data not shown), and numerous biochemical studies are currently ongoing to investigate its efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other active anti-tumor agents against a variety of malignancies. Here, we administered such a combination to MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo, and found that the effect of complementary proteasome inhibitors reduced tumor growth rates more efficiently than compared with when administered alone. Such efforts have led to bortezomib, the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor now used as a frontline treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed/refractory MM and mantle cell lymphoma.

If we use N, M and C to represent the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function of N and M when C \u003d O(log(N + M)). The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm, which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned. The similarities between sequences can be determined by computing their optimal local alignments using the dynamic programming based on the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm [1,2]. When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm.

      "ideal_answer": "Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. A comparative analysis of the expression patterns of intergenic transcripts in brain, heart, testis, and lymphoblastoid cell lines of human and chimpanzee has revealed a tissue-specific conservation pattern, which is similar to that of protein-coding genes. .Compared with protein-coding sequences and small RNAs (e.g., miRNA and snoRNA), lncRNAs are weakly conserved: only approximately 5% of the bases have been estimated to be evolutionarily constrained (Marques and Ponting 2009). hey are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs.

More recently Lobanov et al. have reported that other insect genomes also appear to lack selenoproteins [20]. We have also analyzed the sequences of all other available insect genomes (the mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the wasp Nasonia vitripennis, the beetle Tribolium castaneum and the silkworm Bombyx mori), and found that, while mosquitoes share the selenoprotein complement of D. melanogaster, selenoproteins have been lost in the wasp, the honey bee, the silkworm and the beetle.

      "ideal_answer": ", as splicing is often cotranscriptional, a complex picture emerges in which splicing regulation not only depends on the balance of splicing factor binding to their pre-mRNA target sites but also on transcription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the transcribing machinery and elongation kinetics. Chromatin may not only be involved in alternative splicing regulation but in constitutive exon recognition as well. ere we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. hese span from regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation, which ultimately determines splicing decisions, to splicing factor recruitment by specific histone marks. trong evidence in both yeast and higher eukaryotes demonstrates that recruitment of the spliceosome to intron-containing transcripts occurs co-transcriptionally [3]–[6], mediated at least in part by physical associations between the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and the U1 snRNP [7].

Mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHVs) of CLL cells offers useful prognostic information for high-risk patients. Patients with unmutated IgV(H) gene show a shorter progression-free and overall survival than patients with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgV(H)) gene mutated. Instead, alternative markers of IGHV status, such as zeta-associated protein (ZAP70) or messenger RNA levels are often used. but time and economical costs originally prevented it from being routinely used in a clinical setting.

      "ideal_answer": "Here, we discuss the evidence supporting these ideas, from the first proposal of chromatin affecting alternative splicing, performed 20 years ago, to the latest findings including genome-wide evidence that nucleosomes are preferentially positioned in exons. Nucleosomes were found to be preferentially positioned within constitutive exons and/or constitutive portions of alternative exons, which was not associated with gene expression or states of cells but was based on sequence and positively related with the sequence conservation of splicing sites. Here we show, by analysis of data sets from human sperm and T cells and medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) blastulae, that internal exons of genes are characterized by sharply elevated average nucleosome occupancy in comparison to flanking intronic sequences. Andersson et al. (13) have reported that nucleosomes are well positioned in exons and carry characteristic histone modifications, and Schwartz et al. (14) have described that the chromatin organization marks the exon–intron structure. a large number of histone modifications showed higher levels across exons which, for the most part, could be accounted for by nucleosome distribution, with well-positioned nucleosomes on exons accounting for these patterns. he general link between nucleosome and gene exon–intron architecture has been suggested in previous studies (11,12).

Using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we increased the levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the proximity of alternative exon 33 of the human fibronectin gene, favoring its inclusion into mature messenger RNA (mRNA) through a mechanism that recalls RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing. Here we find that elevated levels of trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys9 (H3K9me3) are a characteristic of the alternative exons of several genes including CD44. he first report shows that a physiological stimulus such as neuron depolarization promotes intragenic histone acetylation (H3K9ac) and chromatin relaxation, causing the skipping of exon 18 of the neural cell adhesion molecule gene. investigation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) locus revealed cell line-specific enrichment of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which was shown to be required to promote the exclusion of one exon of the gene.

      "ideal_answer": "The tRNASec and the SECIS element, an RNA hairpin in the 3′UTR of selenoprotein mRNAs, and two trans-acting proteins, the specialized translation elongation factor eEFSec and the SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SBP2), are the key players of the recoding machinery (. Taken together, these data establish the role of SECp43 and SLA in selenoprotein biosynthesis through interaction with tRNA([Ser]Sec) in a multiprotein complex. These in vivo studies indicate that SPS2 is essential for generating the selenium donor for selenocysteine biosynthesis in mammals, whereas SPS1 probably has a more specialized, non-essential role in selenoprotein metabolism. The process requires the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, tRNASec, and protein factors including the SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2). One homologue of SelD in eukaryotes is SPS1 (selenophosphate synthetase 1) and a second one, SPS2, was identified as a selenoprotein in mammals. Specialized protein complexes that involve SECp43, the Phosphoserine tRNASec Kinase (PSTK) and the Sec synthase are recruited to the tRNASec to ensure proper selenocysteine synthesis (2–4). Ribosomal protein L30 has also been implicated in this mechanism and shown to compete with SBP2 for SECIS binding (5). SPS2 is the selenophosphate synthetase involved in selenocysteine biosynthesis.

      "ideal_answer": "Since certain types of retrotransposons, particularly members of the Alu, L1, and SVA families, are still active, their recent and ongoing propagation generates a unique and important class of human genomic diversity/polymorphism. Half of the human genome is composed of repeated DNA, and some types are mobile within our genome (transposons and retrotransposons). Despite their abundance, only a small fraction of them are currently active in our genome (Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1), Alu, and SVA elements). Alu elements are the most successful SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) in primate genomes and have reached more than 1,000,000 copies in the human genome. Only a few Alu elements are able to retropose, and the factors determining their retroposition capacity are poorly understood. 1 and Alu represent the most prolific human LINE and SINE families, respectively.
