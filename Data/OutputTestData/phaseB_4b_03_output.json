      "ideal_answer": "Depression (usually mild) occurred in 24% of the respondents, being significantly more common in prolonged postoperative headache patients. Time since management, number of symptoms and comorbid medical conditions predicted anxiety, while depression was predicted by number of symptoms. Content analysis indicated that the majority of subjects experienced tiredness, depression, headache, and dryness of eyes and mouth in the postoperative and convalescent phases. Three patients had a depressive disorder in the preoperative assessment. Of the remaining 24 patients, nine (38%) had a depressive disorder at the three month check up. All nine patients with a depressive disorder were women (P \u003d 0·001), giving them a 69% incidence. Deterioration of hearing was the only postoperative detriment associated with a depressive disorder (P \u003d 0·024). Clinically significant anxiety was reported by 29.8% of participants and 10.2% were depressed. "

      "ideal_answer": "We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Using a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the fate of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and identify exonic remnants that have survived the disappearance of their host genes after whole-genome duplication (WGD) in teleosts, we discover a set of 38 candidate cis-regulatory coding exons (RCEs) with predicted target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. Integrating sequence conservation, gene expression data, gene function, epigenetic marks, and other genomic features, we provide extensive evidence that many conserved ancient linkages involve (1) the coordinated transcription of neighboring genes, or (2) genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) in which transcriptional enhancers controlling developmental genes are contained within nearby bystander genes. Specifically, we discuss the recently discovered genomic regulatory blocks which we argue are principal units of vertebrate genome evolution and serve as the foundations onto which evolutionary innovations are built through sequence evolution and insertion of new cis-regulatory elements.

      "ideal_answer": "ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. We discovered classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an individual\u0027s epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making.

This review provides an overview of the role of oral proteasome inhibitors including Marizomib, Oprozomib, Delanzomib, chemical proteasome inhibitors, and cinnabaramides, in the therapy of MM, focusing on developments over the past five years. In addition, novel drug classes have shown promising activity in RR MM, including the orally-administered proteasome inhibitors ixazomib and oprozomib; monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab; and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat and rocilinostat. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable structural analog oprozomib are second-generation, highly-selective, proteasome inhibitors. "

      "ideal_answer": "Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex. STAT3-targeting chemicals and palmitate caused the disruption of inhibitory STAT3-PKR interactions, followed by PKR-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation, which facilitates autophagy induction. These results reveal an unsuspected crosstalk between cellular metabolism (fatty acids), pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3), innate immunity (EIF2AK2), and translational control (EIF2S1) that regulates autophagy. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of PKR and consequent eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PKR depletion inhibited autophagy as initiated by chemical STAT3 inhibitors or free fatty acids like palmitate. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type STAT3 as well as of STAT3 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by JAK2 or are excluded from the nucleus inhibits autophagy. However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy. Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula. Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses autophagy by inhibiting PKR activity. "

This review focuses on the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world settings are underway. CONCLUSIONS: Observed relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin were similar among patients within and outside East Asia. BACKGROUND: Results from a trial of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in 1280 Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation (J-ROCKET AF) revealed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the principal safety outcome.

To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin. In conclusion, we show that FAIRE-seq and ATAC-seq based open chromatin profiling, combined with motif discovery, is a straightforward approach to identify functional genomic regulatory regions, master regulators, and gene regulatory networks controlling complex in vivo processes. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an individual\u0027s epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making.

      "ideal_answer": "Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals. However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small. Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations. Based on quantifying shape changes in signal profiles, it overcomes challenges imposed by the highly structured nature of the data and the paucity of replicates. We here introduce an algorithm, called cosmo, that allows this search to be supervised by specifying a set of constraints that the position weight matrix of the unknown motif must satisfy. Such constraints may be formulated, for example, on the basis of prior knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor in question. We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables. Here, we present MMDiff, a robust, broadly applicable method for detecting differences between sequence count data sets. "

These results show that carfilzomib and ONX 0912 are potently active against HNSCC cells, and the activities of these agents can be enhanced via suppression of Mcl-1 or inhibition of autophagy. Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 potently induced apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines via upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bik. Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 also induced autophagy, mediated, in part, by activation of the UPR pathway involving upregulation of ATF4 transcription factor. These data demonstrate that, in addition to anti-myeloma properties, carfilzomib and oprozomib effectively shift the bone microenvironment from a catabolic to an anabolic state and, similar to bortezomib, may decrease skeletal complications of MM. We recently reported the impact and mechanisms of carfilzomib and oprozomib, second-in-class proteasome inhibitors with higher specificities and reduced toxicities, against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). At clinically relevant concentrations, carfilzomib and oprozomib directly inhibited OC formation and bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. "

      "ideal_answer": "How amino acid levels are communicated to mTORC1 is only recently coming to light by the discovery of a lysosome-based signaling system composed of Rags (Ras-related GTPases) and Ragulator v-ATPase, GATOR (GAP activity towards Rags), and folliculin (FLCN) complexes. A key input is amino acids, which act through the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD) in order to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. mTORC1 promotes growth in response to the availability of nutrients, such as amino acids, which drive mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues. Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome. "

The chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, being involved in chemotaxis, stemness and drug resistance. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been implicated in sarcoma development and has been found to be a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 that has been shown to be implicated in PDAC tumorigenicity and aggressiveness could serve as a prognostic marker for survival after a curative-intent surgery and was associated with the pattern of tumour recurrence (distant versus local relapse). Upregulated expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 is an independent prognostic predictor for patients with gastric cancer. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a marker of metastatic disease. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the high levels of nuclear CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in hepatocytes were significantly better prognostic factors for overall and hepatic disease-free survival in patients with CLM.

Eosinophilia (sometimes exceeding 50%) is often present in patients with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), but may be limited or absent in late fibrotic manifestations of the disease. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Katayama fever by Schistosoma egg detection and/or by seroconversion. BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. The specific diagnosis of early schistosomiasis and Katayama fever relies essentially on serologic tests or preferably on PCR (if available). In Africa, it predominantly manifests as urogenital disease, and the main infective agent is Schistosoma hematobium. His symptoms were caused by acute invasive schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of imported Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) as well as evolution and outcome under treatment. The best therapeutic approach to acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is still unsettled. Laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers. Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. infection. "

To further clarify the contribution of nuclear architecture in the regulation of gene expression patterns during differentiation of human multipotent cells, we analyzed expression status, histone modifications, and subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartments, of hematopoietic loci in multipotent and lineage-committed primary human hematopoietic progenitors. We report here that positioning of lineage-affiliated loci relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin compartments (PCH) is identical in multipotent cells from various origins and is unchanged between multipotent and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors. Our findings indicate that cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression states within preexisting chromosomal compartments. Chromatin modifications in hematopoietic multipotent and committed progenitors are independent of gene subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartments. A number of these proteins accumulate in viral replication compartments in the infected cell nucleus, indicating that these proteins may have a role in viral replication. Cohesin-based chromatin interactions enable regulated gene expression within preexisting architectural compartments. "

Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales. The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression. Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns. "

Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals. due to the diverse functions and variable expression of proteoglycans, matrix proteins, and integrins, it is rather difficult to identify a comprehensive therapeutic target among ECM components. Beta 1 integrin binding plays a role in the constant traction force generation in response to varying stiffness for cells grown on mature cardiac extracellular matrix. the integrin, talin, and actin filament form a linear complex of which both ends are typically anchored to the extracellular matrices via integrins. Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin α5. Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins.

Another RCT showed no difference between amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole efficacies for pneumonia in underweight, but not SAM. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned Malawian children, 6 to 59 months of age, with severe acute malnutrition to receive amoxicillin, cefdinir, or placebo for 7 days in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.

Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week study, reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked. BACKGROUND: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxicant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and dependence. RESULTS: Significant reductions in nicotine intake were observed between usual brand smoking (∼1.2 mg nicotine) and the 0.3 and 0.05 mg nicotine emission cigarettes, but not the 0.6 mg cigarette. Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake.

Mutations in NBEAL2 underlie gray platelet syndrome (GPS), a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a lack of α-granules within blood platelets and progressive bone marrow fibrosis. We detected a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome. NBEAL2 is mutated in gray platelet syndrome and is required for biogenesis of platelet α-granules. A dominant-negative GFI1B mutation in the gray platelet syndrome. "

      "ideal_answer": "Pseudogene OCT4-pg4 functions as a natural micro RNA sponge to regulate OCT4 expression by competing for miR-145 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanistic analysis revealed that OCT4-pg4 functions as a natural micro RNA sponge to protect OCT4 transcript from being inhibited by miR-145. Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges. Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. n this issue, Lalaouna et al. (2015) report another type of RNA sponge, showing that stable intermediates of bacterial tRNA processing control endogenous small RNAs. Natural RNA sponges sequestering cellular noncoding RNA molecules have been found in diverse organisms. Here we show that this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7). "

Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis. Accuracy of the revised Tokuhashi score in predicting survival in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). PURPOSE: The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive value of the Tokuhashi score for life expectancy in Iranian patients with spinal metastases one year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Present study showed that the Tokuhashi revised scoring system may be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring system for patients with spinal metastases in Iran. CONCLUSION: We would conclude that although the predictive value of the Tokuhashi score in terms of survival time is at best modest (66 %), the fact that there were statistically significant differences in survival between the groups looked at in this paper indicates that the scoring system, and the components which it consists of, are important in the evaluation of these patients when considering surgery.

In vitro transcription of viroid RNA into full-length copies by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato leaf tissue. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato plant tissue accepts potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) RNA as a template for the in vitro synthesis of full-length RNA copies of the PSTV genome. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II of plant origin transcribes viroid RNA into full-length copies. Viroid RNA is accepted as a template for in vitro transcription by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli. Tomato RNA polymerase II interacts with the rod-like conformation of the left terminal domain of the potato spindle tuber viroid positive RNA genome. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV. Host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) was proposed to be critical for its replication, but no interaction site for RNAP II on the PSTVd RNA genome was identified. "

      "ideal_answer": "Structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 alone or bound to single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and target DNA revealed a bilobed protein architecture that undergoes major conformational changes upon guide RNA and DNA binding. This new type of genetic library is constructed through the lentiviral delivery of single-guide RNA collections that direct Cas9 or inactive dead Cas9 fused with effectors to interrogate gene function or regulate gene transcription in targeted cells. Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease found in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) bacterial immune systems, is a versatile tool for genome editing, transcriptional regulation, and cellular imaging applications. However, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) parameters affecting the specificity and efficiency of the system in flies are still not clear. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for functional genomic studies in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we found that off-target effects did not occur in regions of genomic DNA with three or more nucleotide mismatches to sgRNAs. "

Cyclophilins belong to the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), which are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes capable of cis/trans isomerizing Xaa-Pro peptide bonds. FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. Cyps (cyclophilins) are ubiquitous proteins of the immunophilin superfamily with proposed functions in protein folding, protein degradation, stress response and signal transduction. Immunophilins are ubiquitous enzymes responsible for proline isomerisation during protein synthesis and for the chaperoning of several membrane proteins. Cyclophilins (Cyps) are ubiquitous proteins that effect the cis-trans isomerization of Pro amide bonds, and are thus crucial to protein folding. Cyclophilins are folding helper enzymes belonging to the class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases; EC 5.2.1.8). Cyclophilin is a ubiquitous peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase that plays critical roles in many biological processes. The receptor for cyclosporin is the protein cyclophilin, which is a ubiquitous peptidylprolyl isomerase. Cyclophilins (CyPs) are a large class of highly conserved ubiquitous peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. "

Dracorhodin perchlorate, an anthocyanin red pigment, induces human melanoma A375-S2 cell death through the apoptotic pathway. Dracorhodin perchlorate suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. CONCLUSION: Therefore DP was a candidate for anti-breast cancer, DP induced apoptosis of MCF-7 through mitochondrial pathway. The growth inhibition and pro-apoptosis effects of dracorhodin perchlorate on human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line were examined. Dracorhodin perchlorate has been recently shown to induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. Dracorhodin perchlorate inhibited proliferation of several tumor cell lines. It was reported that DP could induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer, human gastric tumor cells and human melanoma, but the cytotoxic effect of DP on human breast cancer was not investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown in human gastric tumor cells. "

      "ideal_answer": "Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). Eukaryotic genes are often regulated by several transcription factors whose binding sites are tightly clustered and form cis-regulatory modules. The genomic instructions used to regulate development are encoded within a set of functional DNA elements called cis-regulatory modules. This conserved sequence has therefore been proposed to act as a long-range, cis-acting regulator of limb-specific Shh expression. The conserved upstream sequence can activate gene expression from basal promoters in the brain vesicle, although it requires additional cis-regulatory sequences to fully activate the CNS-specific gene expression. In many species, especially higher eukaryotes, transcription factor binding sites tend to occur as homotypic or heterotypic clusters, also known as cis-regulatory modules. "

An absent word (also called a forbidden word or an unword in other contexts) in a sequence is a segment that does not appear in the given sequence. It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in the given sequence. It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in y. Minimal absent words have been computed in genomes of organisms from all domains of life; their computation also provides a fast alternative for measuring approximation in sequence comparison. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting word is no longer an absent word. An absent word of a word y of length n is a word that does not occur in y. "

Further, to determine whether presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments of neurons are preferentially affected in AD patients, we studied 3 presynaptic vesicle proteins (synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and Rab 3A), 2 synaptic membrane proteins (Gap 43 and synaptobrevin), and 2 postsynaptic proteins (neurogranin and synaptopodin) in specimens from AD and age-matched control brains. These modifications were associated with impaired spatial memory and reduced hippocampal expression of signaling molecules important for synaptic plasticity and memory, including neurogranin, CaMKII, ERK, GSK3β, CREB, and expression of the transcription factor EGR1/Zif268. The elevated neurogranin levels in the MCI and AD groups might reflect synaptic degeneration. Relative quantification revealed a significant increase of neurogranin in the AD group compared with controls, while the MCI group was not statistically different from either controls or the AD group. These results together suggest that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin might be valuable together with the established AD biomarkers in the early diagnosis of AD and warrants further studies to determine the diagnostic value of neurogranin.

To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method \u0027CPModule\u0027. In this work we present CisMiner, a novel methodology to detect putative CRMs by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). However, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs.

The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1-2 weeks. (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. "

This problem was first described by Malgaigne in 1857 in his classic article on double vertical fractures of the pelvis, in which he described a 34-year-old woman with a pelvic fracture who subsequently died during childbirth. The anteroposterior radiographic view revealed ununited fractures at the left superior and inferior pubic ramus, noted as a type I Malgaigne fracture. The authours report the case of a 27-year-old man who had suffered a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the right side, 10 years before. We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) fracture/dislocations. Twenty-six of the thirty-two cadavera that were examined radiographically and dissected had a double break in the pelvic ring (Malgaigne pattern). "

The comparison of two analytical approaches, based on either Over Representation Analysis or Functional Class Scoring, by a meta-analysis-based approach, led to the retrieval of known information about the biological situation - thus validating the model - but also more importantly to the discovery of the previously unknown implication of the spliceosome, the cellular machinery responsible for mRNA splicing, in the development of metastasis. There are three main classes of these methods: over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology based methods. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the significance of the impact of D3T treatment.

Sororin pre-mRNA splicing is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by cohesin and regulated by Sororin, is essential for chromosome segregation. The maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion from S phase to the onset of anaphase relies on a small but evolutionarily conserved protein called Sororin. Sister chromatid cohesion depends on Sororin, a protein that stabilizes acetylated cohesin complexes on DNA by antagonizing the cohesin release factor Wings-apart like protein (Wapl). sororin, a critical regulator that stabilizes cohesin rings in sister chromatids,. Three additional factors Pds5, Wapl, and Sororin bind to cohesin and modulate its dynamic association with chromatin. sororin, a factor required for the stable association of cohesin with chromatin,.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures. Although several reports of cases with the characteristic clinical manifestations of normal pressure hydrocephalus--progressive dementia, gait difficulty and urinary incontinence--have been published earlier, it was Adams and Hakim who emphasized the clinical triad and the effect of shunting the cerebrospinal fluid as a means of treatment. Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies. INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá, Colombia. "

The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) site. These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.

In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2% accuracy and 90% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. Our novel PRISM (predicting regulatory information from single motifs) approach obtains 2543 TF function predictions in a large variety of contexts, at a false discovery rate of 16%. The predictions are highly enriched for validated TF roles, and 45 of 67 (67%) tested binding site regions in five different contexts act as enhancers in functionally matched cells. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1% and accuracy of 89.64%. "

Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies. This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Recent research has focused on replacing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells vital to photoreceptor cell health. In this review, we describe recent approaches to develop cell-based therapies for the treatment of AMD. We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials.

We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression. Arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress. Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death. Arimoclomol, a coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a mouse model in which motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex degenerate. "

Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes. For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of \"arachnodactyly\". Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome. It is of utmost importance to identify patients at risk for acute aortic events to establish the correct surgical timing and the appropriate surgical treatment. The not-uncommon spinal abnormalities associated with Marfan\u0027s syndrome rarely undergird clinical problems, and neurological features accompanying such bone abnormalities are rare. The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation. Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. "

Pluripotent stem cells as a potential tool for disease modelling and cell therapy in diabetes. The insulin-producing cells we obtained from three-gene-modified EBs may be used as seed cells for tissue engineering and may represent a cell replacement strategy for the production of β cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs). "

Currently, two applications for NIPD of Down syndrome have been developed with potential and have displayed positive results; the NIPD using next-generation sequencing technologies and the NIPD using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 by dosage ratio of fetal chromosome-specific epigenetic markers in maternal plasma. This study examined the methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A between maternal and placental DNA, and the implication of this difference in the identification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and in prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21.

Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC. The methylation status of these DMRs was investigated in 61 tumors and matching control lung tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. To identify candidate markers for use in NSCLC diagnosis, we used genomewide DNA methylation maps that we had previously generated by MethylCap and next-generation sequencing and listed the most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We propose a panel of five DMRs, composed of novel and known markers that exhibit high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish tumors from control lung tissues. Analysis of the MethylCap-seq data revealed a strong positive correlation between replicate experiments and between paired tumor/lung samples. We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. "

Classical Heyde syndrome is described as the association of aortic stenosis, bleeding gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and secondary anemia. Nine patients reported clinically significant bleeding, and seven had intestinal angiodysplasia and transfusion-dependent gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde syndrome), with the median number of transfusions required being 20 (IQR 10-33; range 4-50). OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of aortic valve replacement for reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Heyde syndrome, in whom gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with intestinal angiodysplasia and aortic valve stenosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding and aortic stenosis (Heyde syndrome): the role of aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between aortic valve stenosis, acquired von Willebrand disease and gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients is known as Heyde syndrome. A deficiency of high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) (type 2A von Willebrand disease) provides the link between this association, which is known as Heyde syndrome. Aortic valve stenosis can be complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia. Heyde syndrome--the link between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Heyde syndrome (the combination of iron deficiency anemia and aortic stenosis) has been a controversial entity. "

      "ideal_answer": "urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues. Carbamylation is a general process involved in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups. Cyanate, a reactive electrophilic species in equilibrium with urea, posttranslationally modifies proteins through a process called carbamylation, which promotes atherosclerosis. Protein carbamylation, a posttranslational modification promoted during uremia and catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) at sites of inflammation, is linked to altered protein structure, vascular dysfunction, and poor prognosis. Post-translational modification and functional impairment of proteins through carbamylation is thought to promote vascular dysfunction during end-stage renal disease. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines, arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines. Cyanate, a reactive species in equilibrium with urea, carbamylates protein lysine residues to form epsilon-carbamyllysine (homocitrulline), altering protein structure and function. Carbamylation (carbamoylation) of lysine residues and protein N-termini is a nonenzymatic PTM that has been related to protein ageing. "

Pentalogy of Fallot is a rare cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by biventricular origin of the aorta above a large ventricular septal defect, obstruction of the pulmonary outflow, right ventricular hypertrophy (tetralogy of Fallot), and an atrial septal defect. Additionally, an atrial septal defect was found on necropsy, resulting in the final diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot with an atrial septal defect (a subclass of Pentalogy of Fallot). Postmortem examination of the ram\u0027s heart showed a pentalogy of Fallot, consisting of a pulmonic stenosis, a ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta, a right ventricular hypertrophy and a patent foramen ovale.

      "ideal_answer": "Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. De novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. "

      "ideal_answer": "One approach to accomplish this goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can then be used as a template for future systems. This is a helpful way to build a parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state. The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how few genes are required to run a cell. The design and construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome. The identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and essence of life forms. A synthetic minimal cell will provide an appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. "

This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We show that SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE methods. This article contains a protocol for selective 2\u0027-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and sequencing (SHAPE-Seq) that, through a combination of structure-dependent chemical probing and next-generation sequencing technologies, achieves structural characterization of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment. We focus on a novel assay utilizing this approach, called selective 2\u0027-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), that can be used to characterize RNA secondary and tertiary structure. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.

We observed strong up-regulation of SFRP1 expression in all meningiomas with AKT1E17K mutation and in HEK293 cells after transfection with mutant AKT1E17K, but not in meningiomas and HEK293 cells lacking this mutation. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. Recurrent mutations in SMO and AKT1 are mutually exclusive with NF2 loss in meningioma. Genomic sequencing of meningiomas identifies oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations. In contrast, AKT1E17K mutations were rare in WHO grade II and absent in WHO grade III meningiomas. The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas. AKT1E17K mutations cluster with meningothelial and transitional meningiomas and can be detected by SFRP1 immunohistochemistry. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. AKT1E17K mutations were exclusively seen in meningiomas and occurred in 65 of 958 of these tumors. "
