      "ideal_answer": "Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. The gene-fusion approach relies on the observation that pairs of genes encoding proteins of known function (usually interacting or forming a complex) tend to be found in other species as a fused composite gene encoding a single multifunctional protein. Here we have applied gene fusion analysis to a number of recently sequenced protists, and in particular tried to infer interacting protein pairs in the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Some proteins, involved in a common biological process and encoded by separate genes in one organism, can be found fused within a single protein chain in other organisms. Interacting proteins encoded by separate genes in some species, may sometimes occur as a single, multi-domain fusion protein in other species. "

      "ideal_answer": "New data analysis approaches are outlined for the correlated fluctuations in fast WAXS, for protein nanocrystals just a few molecules on a side, and for the continuous x-ray scattering from a single virus. These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump--probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. These fourth-generation X-ray sources promise extremely intense hard X-ray bursts of approximately 100 fs in duration, and will thereby create new opportunities for imaging of biological molecules from extremely small samples (Neutze et al., 2000 ▶, 2004 ▶).Within the realm of time-resolved pump–probe structural studies, the most obvious benefit of these emerging sources will be their remarkable capability to probe the structural dynamics of light-driven reactions with a temporal resolution of 100 fs. We describe the experimental setup and obtain the first time-resolved femtosecond serial X-ray crystallography results from an irreversible photo-chemical reaction at the Linac Coherent Light Source. These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources.

Targeted sequence data of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, generated using a PCR-based, multiplexed NGS approach using the SOLiD 4 (n \u003d 24) and Ion Torrent PGM (n \u003d 20) next-generation sequencers,. V600E amino acid substitution in the activation segment accounts for 90% of BRAF mutations and is significantly associated with microsatellite instability [13]. a HRM assay to identify hotspot mutations in EGFR, KRAS and BRAF oncogenes, and investigate the potential application of ultra-deep amplicon pyrosequencing for somatic variation detection in clinical sample. Data from retrospective studies suggest that mutated BRAF, which is present in 5-10% of colorectal tumours, can affect the response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in patients with wild type KRAS [14-16], 40-60% of whom do not respond to such therapy [17].Current guidelines in the US state that patients with metastatic CRC being considered for EGFR-targeted therapies should be tested for KRAS and BRAF mutations [18], and recommend EGFR testing for patients with advanced NSCLC to predict response to first-line TK inhibitors [19,20].

In this paper, based on the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAA) that can incorporate sequence-order information of a protein sequence so as to remarkably enhance the power of discrete models (Chou, K. C., Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43: 246-255), cellular automata and Lempel-Ziv complexity are introduced to predict the TM regions of integral membrane proteins including both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins, validated by jackknife test.

In this article, we describe an online Web service–PIE (Protein interaction information extraction system)–for providing biologists with extracted PPI sentences from text. The PIE interface is carefully designed to help biologists and bio-system developers, featuring PDF and HTML support, customized PubMed searching, PPI visualization and network communication. eFIP integrates our previously developed tools, Extracting Gene Related ABstracts (eGRAB) for document retrieval and name disambiguation, Rule-based LIterature Mining System (RLIMS-P) for Protein Phosphorylation for extraction of phosphorylation information, a PPI module to detect PPIs involving phosphorylated proteins and an impact module for relation extraction. GeneView recognizes a broader set of entity types but not gene ontology terms, provides search facilities using unique database identifiers and also finds relationships between proteins in texts. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm by a frame-based approach for a web-based tool, PPI Finder, which can not only find the related genes of the gene of interest based on their co-occurrence frequencies but also extract the semantic descriptions of interactions from the co-occurring literature by computational linguistic methods.

To check similarity between the interacting proteins, we used a Smith-Waterman dynamic programming alignment tool [30,31] (prss33) with a threshold p-value of 0.04.Promiscuous Domain FilteringWe calculated the domain architecture of all protein sequences using HMMER [32] against the PFAM (v15) database [11] as a reference, using an e-value threshold of E ≤ 1e-10. we refer to the fused gene as a \u0027composite\u0027 protein, while the un-fused counterpart genes in the reference organism are referred to as \u0027component\u0027 proteins [1,3].The accuracy of this approach has previously been demonstrated [3,9], however the presence of so-called \u0027promiscuous domains\u0027 in eukaryotic species has made it problematic to apply this method across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. In the gene fusion method, two or more proteins were identified to be functionally linked when they were not encoded by neighboring genes in E. coli but were uniquely homologous to a single protein in a reference organism.

      "ideal_answer": "Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. These trees defined timelines of architectural discovery and revealed remarkable evolutionary patterns, including the explosive appearance of domain combinations during the rise of organismal lineages, the dominance of domain fusion processes throughout evolution, and the late appearance of a new class of multifunctional modules in Eukarya by fission of domain combinations. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results. Lastly, for merge and split events, a comparison of their counts revealed a 0.86:1 merge-to-split ratio, which at first seemed inconsistent with previous studies suggesting that fusion occurs more often than fission by a factor of 2.6–5.6 (Snel et al. 2000, Kummerfeld and Teichmann 2005, Fong et al. 2007).

Paralleling clinical experience, a non-linear correlation was found between this default/“internal” network connectivity and the level of consciousness ranging from healthy volunteers and pseudocoma/locked-in syndrome, to minimally conscious, vegetative/unresponsive, and comatose patients. On the other hand, the connectivity between these primary cortices and “higher-order” associative cortices as well as connectivity inside the nodes of the default/“internal” network show a correlation decreasing consciousness in both coma and anesthesia. This report shows for the first time, in three patients, that the persistent vegetative state (PVS) is marked by a dysfunctional default mode network, with decreased connectivity in several brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex, especially in the right hemisphere. . Therefore, diminished or absent (like in the beta2 frequency band) operational synchrony4 within the DMN in patients with severe brain injuries suggests a disruption of this network, all the way down to complete absence of any self-awareness, as in the VS patients of this study.

In this study we analyzed the morphologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the psammoma bodies in ten meningiomas of different histologic subtypes, characterizing the components of the psammoma body and the elements of the tumor, such as the capillaries and degenerative cells that have been classically considered as initiators of the formation of these calcareous is structures. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. The results suggest that psammoma bodies in meningiomas arise in part from meningothelial whorls due to collagen production by tumor cells followed by obliteration and disappearance of tumor cell processes, although some of the alternative pathways for psammoma body formation proposed by other investigators cannot be ruled out by this study.

CONCLUSIONS: Gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, multiple preovulatory follicles, and a persistently elevated serum estradiol concentration. Pregnancy in a woman with active acromegaly is very rare, because amenorrhea, due to hyperprolactinemia and disturbed pituitary gonadotropin secretion may cause infertility. RESULTS: Regular menses resumed soon after excision of the gonadotroph adenoma, followed by a spontaneous pregnancy. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, occurring mostly in women and presenting most commonly with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. All patients in the study were treated with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a pregnancy. "

      "ideal_answer": "These SDs, often referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations, cause vasoconstriction and recruitment of the penumbra into the ischemic core in the critical first hours after focal ischemic stroke; however, the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of SD-induced injury to synaptic circuitry in the penumbra remain unknown. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate increase of collateral blood supply. Spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. Spreading depression (SD) has been demonstrated following focal ischemia, and the additional workload imposed by SD on a tissue already compromised by a marked reduction in blood flow may contribute to the evolution of irreversible damage in the ischemic penumbra. During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate.

Intracranial hypertension was associated with an inflammatory response, indicating activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain (ECF) and systemic circulation with high IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels after SAH, the latter associated with unfavourable outcome. The CRP and TGF-beta1 levels in CSF are strongly concerned with communicating hydrocephalus after SAH. Occurrence of infectious complications and application of therapeutic hypothermia were assessed as confounding factors. Twenty-three and 28 patients showed poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm after SAH, respectively.

The results suggest that depression and decreased QOL among low-grade glioma patients is related to shorter survival at long-term follow-up. The adverse impact of depression in relation to survival among cancer patients is currently a subject of great interest in research. In the subgroup of patients with low-grade gliomas, depressive patients had a significantly shorter survival time compared with nondepressive subjects (P \u003d 0.031, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis). Preoperative depression seemed to be a significant prognostic factor for worse survival in low-grade glioma patients.

Major depressive disorder was marginally associated with outcomes, while surgical interventions and radiotherapy did not show strong associations with test performances. These scores were significantly higher in patients with a history of depression (p \u003d 0.017) and in those with a lower functional outcome (p \u003d 0.015).

The HRC(S96A) mutant exacerbated the inhibitory effects of HRC(WT) on the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients, prolongation of Ca(2+) decay time, and caffeine-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release. Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks, which was reduced by HRC(WT), was increased by mutant HRC(S96A) under resting conditions although there were no spontaneous Ca(2+) waves under stress conditions. However, expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic Ca(2+) transients. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. the genetic variant of Ser96Ala in HRC correlates with ventricular arrhythmogenesis and sudden death in DCM patients, suggesting that HRC may play a modifying role in the progression of this disease. Consistent with these findings, HRC(S96A) reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC(WT). "

These heart hormones were evaluated for their ability to inhibit sFRP-3, which is associated with tumor invasiveness, in human pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and renal adenocarcinoma cell lines. The ability of Frzb/secreted Frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3) to inhibit Wnt signaling and the localization of Frzb/sFRP3 on chromosome 2q to a region frequently deleted in cancers have led some investigators to hypothesize that Frzb/sFRP3 is a tumor suppressor gene. .

Drosophila Bld10, the ortholog of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Bld10p and human Cep135, is a ubiquitous centriolar protein that also localizes to the spermatid basal body. Thus, in flies, Cep135/Bld10 is not essential for cartwheel assembly or for establishing the ninefold symmetry of centrioles; rather, it appears to stabilize the connection between inner and outer centriole components. In the present study, we investigated a novel interaction between CEP135 and C-NAP1, two core centriolar proteins. Cep135/Bld10 is a conserved centriolar protein required for the formation of the central cartwheel, an early intermediate in centriole assembly. BLD10/CEP135 is a microtubule-associated protein that controls the formation of the flagellum central microtubule pair. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS6, SAS4/CPAP and BLD10/CEP135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. . Centrosome components, including γ-tubulin and Cep135,. It is thus suggested that Cep135 may play an important role in organizing the functional centrosome.

Twelve adults with severe axial dystonia, and two children with life-threatening generalised dystonia were treated with a combination of a low constant dose of tetrabenazine to which were added pimozide and benzhexol as necessary. 8-year-old boy of non-Jewish, Mexican-American descent with autosomal-dominant dystonia musculorum deformans who developed rapidly progressive and severe generalized dystonia, hyperpyrexia, myoglobinuria, and renal failure. The patient\u0027s dystonia responded to Trihexyphenidyl and to tetrabenazine, but these medications needed to be stopped because of side effects. The most frequently helpful medications were tetrabenazine (68% of patients improved) and anticholinergics (39% improved). Pharmacological treatment with tetrabenazine, clonazepam and trihexiphenydile allowed a very limited improvement of dystonia;. The global response rating of 1 (marked improvement) was recorded in 89.2% of 93 patients with tardive stereotypy, 83.3% of 12 with myoclonus, 82.8% of 29 with Huntington\u0027s disease, 80.5% of 82 with tardive dystonia, 79.3% of 29 with other movement disorders, 62.9% of 108 with idiopathic dystonia.

      "ideal_answer": "Among children without systemic arthritis, methotrexate use was most strongly associated with uveitis (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.6-7.6),. Nearly one-half received biologic DMARD, and their use was strongly associated with RF-positive polyarthritis, PsA, uveitis, and systemic arthritis. The first-line standard therapy for uveitis is topical and systemic corticosteroids, often reinforced by methotrexate as a second-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Many children respond to traditional treatments which include a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids (intra-articular, pulsed intravenous, oral) and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) of which methotrexate is most commonly used. Adalimumab was a good option in the treatment of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and associated uveitis, often in combination with methotrexate and/or other DMARDs. Eighteen patients (18/22; 82%) showed improvement of their uveitis with a significant decrease in activity of AC inflammation after a minimal period of 3 months of MTX treatment. The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis. "

The \u0027Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing cardiovascular Events\u0027 (UMPIRE) trial assesses whether a polypill strategy (by combining aspirin, a statin and two blood pressure lowering agents) would improve adherence to guideline-indicated therapies and would lower both blood pressure and cholesterol, in people with established cardiovascular disease. In the 8 years since this paper was published, various pilot studies and Phase II trials of other single-pill combinations of antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medications, and aspirin (eg, the Polycap, which contains low doses of thiazide, atenolol, ramipril, simvastatin, and aspirin) have been completed and published. Moreover, a potential beneficial interaction between atorvastatin and amlodipine was suggested by the results of a pre-specified 2 × 2 factorial analysis of data from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT).

Across all 11 probiotic species and the eight different gastrointestinal diseases we found a significant effect of probiotics on prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disease with a RR \u003d 0.58 (95% CI 0.51–0.65). Current evidence indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific, they do not act through the same mechanisms, and nor are all probiotics indicated for the same health conditions. The GIT diseases considered here can be grouped into three groups based on symptomology: 1) production of diarrhea: AAD, CDD, ID, TD, 2) the destruction or inflammation of tissues in the stomach, large intestine, ileal reservoir, or bowel: NEC, Pouch, and HPP, 3) abdominal pain, flatulence, and irregular bowel movements: IBS. Probiotics, products or preparations containing sufficient amounts of viable microorganisms to alter a host\u0027s microflora communities [13], are thought to exert beneficial effects by providing protective barriers, enhancing immune responses, and clearing pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.

      "ideal_answer": "A parent report of comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety was associated with a high rate of use, with 80% receiving ≥ 1 psychotropic medication. Steingard et al. published a case series of nine children with autism (6–12 years) treated with a low dose of sertraline (25–50 mg daily). This pilot, randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skills Intervention (MASSI) program in a sample of 30 adolescents with ASD and anxiety symptoms of moderate or greater severity. Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD.

Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls. A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. "

Lactase deficiency not associated with intestinal inflammation or injury is common in autistic children and may contribute to abdominal discomfort, pain and observed aberrant behavior. Comparison of the ASD and control group during the first 3.5 years of life showed no major differences in stool colour or consistency, or in frequency of diarrhoea, constipation, bloody stools or abdominal pain. The absence of any correlation between the clinical history and the degree of fecal impaction in autistic children confirms the importance of an abdominal radiograph in the assessment of their degree of constipation. In a sample of 137 children, age 24-96 months, classified as having autism or ASD by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic, 24 percent had a history of at least one chronic gastrointestinal symptom. Information on children\u0027s stool patterns and gut symptoms collected by questionnaire at 4 weeks and at 6, 18, 30 and 42 months of age were available for 12,984 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

A single study has demonstrated an independent association of 25-OH-D at 16 weeks’ gestation with GDM as defined by American Diabetes Association criteria (4); however, 25-OH-D deficiency was much less prevalent and 25-OH-D levels were determined by immunoassay, a methodology subsequently dropped by the Centers for Disease Control in favor of LC-MS/MS as a result of the poor specificity of immunoassays compared with chromatographic methods. These results suggested that rates of vitamin D deficiency are higher among women with IGT/GDM, and the relationship between vitamin D status and glucose tolerance in pregnancy needs further study. This review discusses the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of GDM and vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women, outlines the possible mechanism of action of vitamin D in glucose homeostasis, and summarizes emerging evidence that associates vitamin D deficiency with the risk of developing GDM.

In the first 2 populations, use of antibiotics was associated with an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but in intensive care patients the opposite was documented. A short prophylactic treatment course with azithromycin is a good alternative in the management of patients with severe, advanced COPD, and could lead to an improvement in social and healthcare costs. Guidelines do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that they may reduce the number of exacerbations. Study patients suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections, COPD or were mechanically ventilated in intensive care units. "

There were no differences in long-term outcome between the allopurinol-treated infants and controls. A more recent paper by Gunes et al [8] reports an improved neurological outcome after postnatal ALLO administration compared to a placebo in term asphyxiated neonates. Animal and human studies suggest that administration of ALLO immediately prior to delivery in case of suspected foetal asphyxia might reduce hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. A prospective randomized study in human neonates, examining the effects of ALLO in term asphyxiated neonates, showed an improvement of electrocortical brain activity and a reduction in free radical formation after neonatal ALLO administration. The reported data may suggest a (neuro)protective effect of neonatal allopurinol treatment in moderately asphyxiated infants. This study suggests a beneficial effect of ALLO treatment on free radical formation, CBV, and electrical brain activity, without toxic side effects. Potential neuroprotective strategies targeting different pathways leading to neuronal cell death in response to hypoxic-ischemic insult have been investigated: hypothermia, erythropoietin, iminobiotin, deferioxamine, magnesium, allopurinol, xenon, melatonin and statins.

Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n\u003d26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child.

      "ideal_answer": "These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves\u0027 disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves\u0027 disease with immunosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. It is possible that this patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia. To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves\u0027 disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. "

      "ideal_answer": "Caudal clonidine at a lower dose (1 μg kg⁻¹) could be effective in reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation in children undergoing urogenital and lower limb surgery without any significant adverse effects. In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 microg kg-1 reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative side-effects. Children receiving clonidine immediately after anesthesia induction had statistically significant improvement in postoperative agitation at the 15-minute mark (P \u003d .096). hildren receiving clonidine prior to undergoing strabismus surgery have a small but noticeable reduction in postoperative agitation, stay slightly longer in the post-anesthesia care unit, and have higher rates of parent satisfaction. Clonidine 2 microg/kg IV after anesthetic induction effectively reduces the incidence of agitation without resulting in clinically relevant bradycardia and hypotension. We report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric patients, all for different indications. One patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was observed (P \u003c 0.001). Clonidine has proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of post-operative agitation at a higher dose (3 and 2 μg kg⁻¹). "

      "ideal_answer": "Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life. Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. Fantl et al. in a randomized clinical trial showed a 57% reduction in incontinence episodes in older women; there was, however, no objective improvement on urodynamic parameters post bladder training.[22].

From a number of different Aspergillus terreus controlled batch fermentations, those cultures with the largest difference in itaconic acid titer and productivity were selected for mRNA isolation. Cloning of the cadA gene into the citric acid producing fungus A. niger showed that it is possible to produce itaconic acid also in a different host organism. Reduced by-product formation and modified oxygen availability improve itaconic acid production in Aspergillus niger. Based on its high citric acid producing capability and broad applicability in industry, Aspergillus niger (A.

      "ideal_answer": "We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. Recently, we have demonstrated that treatment with a G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in the BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. Large expansions of a non-coding GGGGCC-repeat in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene are a common cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a G-rich region between nucleotides 66 and 94 of the ADAM10 5\u0027-UTR forms a highly stable, intramolecular, parallel G-quadruplex secondary structure under physiological conditions. We recently reported that a guanosine-rich 40-mer DNA aptamer (LJM-3064) mediates remyelination in the Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Up-regulating relaxin expression by G-quadruplex interactive ligand to achieve antifibrotic action. "

To detect functionally relevant genomic features that underwent positive selection in humans since the separation from their common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos, several authors identified genomic regions that are conserved among vertebrates but have accumulated substitutions on the human lineage at an accelerated rate. several groups have searched for positive selection along the human lineage by focusing on those previously slowly evolving regions of the genome that have evolved most quickly along the human lineage. These regions, such as those in the set of Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) [7], may include some of the genetic changes that make our species biologically unique. This identified Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), a rapidly-evolving cis-antisense locus that is specifically transcribed in the nervous system. the fast-evolving sequences are called human accelerated regions (HARs) or human accelerated conserved noncoding sequences. We devised a ranking of regions in the human genome that show significant evolutionary acceleration. regions in the human genome that show significant evolutionary acceleration. "

Expression of SMIM1 cDNA in Vel- cultured cells generated anti-Vel cell surface reactivity, confirming that SMIM1 encoded the Vel blood group antigen. Anti-Vel is an uncommon antibody to a high-prevalence antigen. Disruption of SMIM1 causes the Vel- blood type. Mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing identified this protein to be small integral membrane protein 1 (SMIM1), a previously uncharacterized single-pass membrane protein. Its clinical significance and management in the prenatal setting are not well characterized. A haemolytic anti-Vel was detected in the tube test. In contrast, the particular commercial gel test kit used did not reveal the haemolytic property or specificity of the antibody. Haemolytic disease of the newborn because of rare anti-Vel. "

Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory. Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality. \u003cdiv class\u003d\"row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"span7\"\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"span7\"\u003e\u003cdiv id\u003d\"viewer\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eVO(2max) is positively associated with telomere length, and we found that long-term endurance exercise training may provide a protective effect on muscle telomere length in older people.\u003c/p\u003e. CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. "

The improved cardiac function was associated with decreased atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels in the metformin-treated group (50% reduction compared with MI, P \u003c 0.05). These results suggest that AMPK activation by metformin and the subsequent suppression of TLRs activity could be considered as a target in protecting the infarcted heart, which may indicate a link between AMPK and TLRs. These data suggest that adiponectin protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through both AMPK- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms. The activation of AMPK by metformin prevents cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of cellular energy. "

      "ideal_answer": "With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. Transient cotransfection of P450R promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs and the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TR beta1) expression plasmid into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells resulted in a 2.4-fold induction of promoter activity that was both T3 and TR beta1 dependent. However, the T3-activated expression of the GH gene in GH3-PV and ME gene in SK-Hep-1-PV was repressed by approximately 30% and 90%, respectively, indicating the lack of correlation of PV/TRpbeta1 protein ratio with the dominant negative potency of mutant PV. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. our data suggests that TRbeta1-mediated down regulation of hepatic LDLr gene may play a critical role in iodine excess-induced hypercholesterolemic effects. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally. "

Liver and kidney D1 mRNA and activity levels were reduced in TRbeta(-/-) but not TRalpha1(-/-) mice. Our results showed that hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase was up-regulated and pyruvate kinase mRNA down-regulated, contrary to what observed after T(3) treatment. Mice expressing the mutant thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1R384C, which has a 10-fold reduced affinity to the ligand T(3), exhibit hypermetabolism due to an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Physiologically, these findings suggest a critical role for TRbeta in regulating the thyroid hormone status through D1-mediated metabolism. To define the consequences in the liver, we analyzed hepatic metabolism and the regulation of liver genes in the mutant mice. "

In contrast to gene hypermethylation, genomic DNA hypomethylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive elements and loss of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, occurred in both early and late stages of prostate cancer. Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA was one of the first somatic epigenetic alterations discovered in human cancers. Contrary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all human cancers, we show that reductions in (5me)C content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a significant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease. These findings provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation changes occur later in prostate carcinogenesis than the CpG island hypermethylation changes and occur heterogeneously during prostate cancer progression and metastatic dissemination. We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (\u003e100 kb) hypomethylation. "

These findings suggest that the difference in drug sensitivities to doxorubicin and etoposide in human lung cancer cell lines might not be explainable by the topoisomerase II alpha levels and topoisomerase II catalytic activity. Recent reports have proposed topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) biomarker status as a potential predictor of tumor responsiveness to doxorubicin (DOX) therapy. In conclusion, compounds BD 13, BD 14, BD 16, D 23 and D 24 may be useful for the treatment of different multidrug-resistant cancer cells with cross resistance against \"classical\" Topo II-targeting drugs. The polyamine tail supports three complementary functions: (a) facilitate formulation of a water-soluble compound, (b) increase DNA binding to reinforce topoisomerase II inhibition, and (c) facilitate selective uptake by tumor cells via the PTS. Twenty previously synthesized fused heterocyclic DNA-topoisomerase II (Topo II)-inhibiting compounds were investigated for their potential efficacy in various human cancer cell lines that were derived from different tumor entities.

      "ideal_answer": "our study established a novel approach utilizing high-resolution SNP array to identify lincRNA candidates, which could functionally link to tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the expression pattern of HOTAIR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its clinical significance as well as its biological role in tumor progression. although the clinical significance of HOTAIR expression in HCC may not be as pronounced as that in breast and colorectal cancers, the current study demonstrates that HOTAIR expression is associated with HCC progression, warranting further studies. CRNDE is the gene symbol for Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (non-protein-coding), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene that expresses multiple splice variants and displays a very tissue-specific pattern of expression. We hypothesized that altered HOTAIR expression may be involved in human cancer by promoting genomic relocalization of Polycomb complex and H3K27 trimethylation. Previous reports have demonstrated that HOTAIR associates with chromatin modifications in cooperation with the Polycomb complex PRC2, and promotes breast and colorectal cancer metastasis. These data suggest that upregulated H19 enhances bladder cancer metastasis by associating with EZH2 and inhibiting E-cad expression. Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is an independent prognostic marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression and survival. "

Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a developmental disorder comprising abnormalities that include mental retardation, an unusual facial appearance, broad thumbs and big toes is frequently associated with molecular lesions in the CREB-binding protein gene, CREBBP. A certain level of CREB-binding protein is essential for normal development, since inactivation of one allele causes Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots in which ten novel pathogenic mutations were localized. these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression. The p.Thr910Ala variant is outside the crucial histone acetyltransferase domain, and this may explain the mild and variable phenotype. "

To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors, we have conducted preclinical trials with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, in the R6/2 HD mouse model. SAHA has been reported to inhibit the eleven Zn2+ dependent HDAC enzymes. SAHA decreases HDAC 2 and 4 levels in vivo and improves molecular phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington\u0027s disease. The novel neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of SAHA demonstrated in this study suggest that further study of this HDAC inhibitor could provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. we might speculate that the mechanism through which SAHA leads to a reduction in HDAC4 is through RANBP2-mediated proteasome degradation as determined for cancer cell lines. SAHA can lead to the degradation of class IIa HDACs 4 and 5 via RANBP2 mediated proteasome degradation in vitro. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential new indications of SAHA for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases in in vitro Parkinson\u0027s disease models. SAHA displayed dose- and time-dependent prolongation of the survival and protection against neurotoxin-induced neuronal death of dopaminergic neurons. "

The peptide is bound in the conventional manner; i.e., the methyl-lysine is oriented on the opposite surface of SMYD3 from the SAM/Sinefungin methyl donor, with a narrow channel connecting the two surfaces of the SET domain. Based on known SET domain structures, the mutations likely affect either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine predicted to interact with the substrate lysine epsilon-amino group. When the serine residue is mutated to glutamic acid, which mimics the phosphorylated serine residue, the mutant CARM1 exhibits diminished ability to bind the methyl donor adenosylmethionine and diminished histone methylation activity. Also, S-adenosylhomocysteine or methyl donor deficiency inhibits RIZ1 and other H3 lysine 9 methylation activities. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation was fed with ethanol for 1month in order to modify the effects of ethanol on rat liver. For radioactive based assays, 2 µCi S-adenosyl-L–[methyl-3H] methionine (SAM; Amersham Biosciences) was included as a methyl donor. "

Unlike any previous tool for inferring phylogenies from rearrangement data, TIBA uses novel methods of robustness estimation to provide support values for the edges in the inferred tree. SuperTRI: A new approach based on branch support analyses of multiple independent data sets for assessing reliability of phylogenetic inferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, called SuperTRI, which is based on the branch support analyses of the independent data sets, and where the reliability of the nodes is assessed using three measures: the supertree Bootstrap percentage and two other values calculated from the separate analyses: the mean branch support (mean Bootstrap percentage or mean posterior probability) and the reproducibility index. Moreover, whereas phylogenetic analyses from sequence data are deemed incomplete unless bootstrapping scores (a measure of confidence) are given for each tree edge, no equivalent to bootstrapping exists for rearrangement-based phylogenetic analysis. However, with the latest program version of RAxML implementing partitioned analysis, rapid bootstrap functions, and the ability of parallel analyses, even very large data sets, can be analyzed in a reasonable amount of time.

The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Four alleles of dMi-2 mutants were further characterized in molecular nature; dMi-2(BL1) was found to have a mutation in the ATP-binding motif of the ATPase domain, dMi-2(BL7) in the core histidine of the first plant homeodomain zinc finger and dMi-2(BL12) in a conserved serine in the chromodomain. Critical comparison of the structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43 with those found in nuclear chromodomain proteins revealed that the diverse protein-protein interactions mediated by the CDs appear to stem from the differences that exist in the surface charge potentials of each CD. Both proteins, ScoHET1 of 37 kDa and ScoHET2 of 44 kDa, display two chromodomain motifs that contain the conserved residues essential for the recognition of methylated histone H3 at lysine 9. "

By shortening the action potential duration in HCM cardiomyocytes, ranolazine reduced the occurrence of early and delayed afterdepolarizations. Finally, as a result of the faster kinetics of Ca(2+)(i) transients and the lower diastolic Ca(2+)(i), ranolazine accelerated the contraction-relaxation cycle of HCM trabeculae, ameliorating diastolic function. Ranolazine at therapeutic concentrations partially reversed the HCM-related cellular abnormalities via I(NaL) inhibition, with negligible effects in controls. Such changes were related to enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity and increased phosphorylation of its targets. "

The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose induces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium.

Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction has been attributed, in part, to calcium overload within individual myocytes. High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. "

Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector. Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic. For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. n Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. "

Thirdly, CHROMOMETHYLASES (CMTs), a plant-specific DNA methyltransferase family, are involved primarily in the maintenance of symmetrical CHG methylation (Lindroth et al., 2001; Papa et al., 2001). These include a promising allelic series for a chromomethylase gene that had been previously implicated in non-CpG DNA methylation, whose counterpart in Arabidopsis is responsible for epigenetic gene silencing and genome surveillance. The drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants did not affect CpG methylation at any locus tested, suggesting that the primary CpG methylases are encoded by the MET1 class of genes. A speculative model of the CMT3-induced egg cell silencing is presented here, based on these results and current data from the literature suggesting the potential involvement of small RNAs targeted to the egg cell, a process conceptually similar to the division of labor described in the male gametophyte for which we show that H3K9 modifications and TFL2 localization are reminiscent of the female gametophyte.

Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N \u003d A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could account for the observation that in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. Many plant, animal, and fungal genomes contain cytosine DNA methylation in asymmetric sequence contexts (CpHpH, H \u003d A, T, C). Dual binding of chromomethylase domains to H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes directs DNA methylation in plants. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp. Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene. "

The innate immune system of Anopheles, this malaria vector\u0027s main line of defense against the Plasmodium parasite, is engaged at multiple stages of parasite infection [1]–[3]. The culminating step of the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is the spectacular release of multiple invasive merozoites on rupture of the infected erythrocyte membrane. Whereas no biological activity was previously identified for 1, the material derived from the efficient synthesis enabled additional bioactivity tests leading to the identification of a notable activity against insect cells and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria. The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein.

We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type.

We have mapped the human Jagged1 gene (JAG1), encoding a ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, to the Alagille syndrome critical region within 20p12. Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). Table 3) identified a substantial fraction (6 novel mutations in 5 out of 42 patients) harboring somatic heterozygous mutations in multiple Notch pathway genes including NCSTN, APH1, MAML1 and NOTCH2. In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome.

      "ideal_answer": "mRNA expression analysis of lung tumor bearing mice suggested that the enhanced chemopreventive activity of the combination is related to atorvastatin modulation of DNA repair, SAHA modulation of angiogenesis, and both drugs modulating invasion and metastasis pathways. JNJ-26481585 also fully inhibited the growth of C170HM2 colorectal liver metastases, whereas again 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin showed modest activity. In conclusion, sequential treatments of mice with MS-275 followed by TRAIL may target multiple pathways to reverse EMT and inhibit tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis and represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer. Since prolonged oral administration with 50 mg/kg or a single oral dose of 1.2 g/kg AN-7 did not cause adverse effects and the former exhibited significant anticancer activity, AN-7 is likely to display a high therapeutic index and may be beneficial for prostate cancer patients. Although not meeting the RECIST response criteria for adequate single-agent activity, the observed tolerable toxicities and the potential for clinical benefit in terms of stable disease suggest that further assessment of vorinostat as a part of combination therapy with either chemotherapeutic or targeted agents in metastatic breast might be undertaken.

We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy. The computer program SeqHelp organizes information from database searches, gene structure prediction, and other information to generate multiply aligned, hypertext-linked reports to allow for fast analysis of molecular sequences. Moreover, computational gene finding in newly sequenced genomes is especially a difficult task due to the absence of a training set of abundant validated genes. "

      "ideal_answer": "We recently reported that diabetes depresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, inhibits MAPK8/JNK1-BCL2 signaling. Activation of AMPK directly phosphorylates MAPK8, which mediates BCL2 phosphorylation and subsequent BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, leading to restoration of cardiac autophagy, protection against cardiac apoptosis, and ultimately improvement in cardiac structure and function. We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. Trimetazidine also caused AMPK activation and reduced PGC-1 alpha expression in the hearts of db/db mice. Taken together, it is suggested that the modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. "

In rare cases, autoimmune IIT also manifests as Graves\u0027 disease, which is defined by antithyroid antibodies with hyperthyroidism. Rarely, IFNα induces Graves\u0027 disease, the diagnosis of which is based on hyperthyroidism with goiter and the presence of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies.7 Its treatment demands precaution due to the hepatotoxic and hematologic side effects of antithyroid drugs.Destructive thyroiditis represents a form of non-autoimmune IIT characterized by self-limited thyrotoxicosis with a triphasic evolution similar to that of subacute thyroiditis. . Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with interferon-induced destructive thyroiditis and prescribed propranolol 20 mg/d for one month. In addition, cases 10 and 14 had subclinical hypothyroidism which resolved with time and did not require thyroxine at any stage, Table 2. Similarly, case 13 was in the hypothyroid phase of the thyroiditis at the end of treatment, was treated expectantly and resolved without thyroxine.

These introns contained an extended and nearly invariant 5\u0027 splice site (ATATCCTT at +1 to +8 positions starting from the 5\u0027 junction), a more pronounced Branch Point Site (BPS, TCCTTAAC), and an AC acceptor site. he acceptor site is unique in that the 3′-most nucleotide of the U12 acceptor site is more tolerant of substitutions, especially in those introns that begin with AT; AT–AC, AT–AA, AT–AG and AT–AT combinations have been observed (14,15). About 1-2% of introns are non-canonical, with the most abundant subtype of non-canonical introns being characterized by GC and AG dinucleotides at their 5\u0027- and 3\u0027-termini, respectively. Our results indicate that the incorporation of non-canonical splice site models yields dramatic improvements in annotating genes containing GC-AG and AT-AC non-canonical introns. If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24% of splice site pairs should be GT-AG, 0.69% GC-AG, 0.05% AT-AC and finally only 0.02% could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites.

Although in this study we focused on the antagonistic function of AIMP2-DX2 against the pro-apoptotic activity of AIMP2-F via p53 in response to DNA damage, it may also influence the normal activity of AIMP2 in these two other pathways with a similar mode of action, namely, through the competitive binding to the target proteins. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. Bortezomib induces mitochondrial damage in native cells and also activates the UPR by splicing of Xbp-1 and induction of CHOP, which is significantly reduced by silencing of MUC4. Although p53-deficient cancer cells are less responsive to chemotherapy, their resistance is not complete, which suggests that other apoptotic pathways may exist. We demonstrate that E2F1 requires SC35 to switch the alternative splicing profile of various apoptotic genes such as c-flip, caspases-8 and -9 and Bcl-x, towards the expression of pro-apoptotic splice variants.

This multicenter investigation into the phenotypic correlates of MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome has provided a greater depth of understanding than hitherto available about the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with commonly occurring mutations. We searched for mutations by sequencing the MECP2 coding region in 45 sporadic cases (35 with classic RTT, eight with variant forms and two males) and in seven families with two or more affected females.

The results showed that tumorigenicity and decreased serum requirement were associated with the ability of E6 to bind to p53, although the subsequent degradation of p53 was not required for these functions. The results from this study support the theory that p53 protein binds HPV-16/18 E6 protein in the cell cytoplasm, thus preventing p53 from exerting its tumor-suppressor function in the nucleus. First, we found that human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncogenes, which block the function of the p53 and Rb tumor suppressors, respectively, and SV40 small t antigen were required to allow mutant K-Ras(12D) growth transformation. Hence, inactivation of wild-type p53 by p53-E6 complex formation in cervical cancer may be a critical step in malignant transformation. The recognition of a causal relationship between human papillomaviruses and cancer almost 30 years ago led to a rapid expansion of knowledge in the field, resulting in the description of the main mediators of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, the viral proteins E6 and E7.

The distribution of 32,361 UCs’ average expression levels in the 24 samples showed that half of the UCs were expressed at less than 0.19 FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) and three-quarters of the UCs were expressed at less than 4.81 FPKM (Additional file\n1: Figure S10). These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data.

We were able to detect a protein fragment corresponding to the expected molecular mass (30 kDa) for type III deiodinase by means of Western blot analysis. However, regulation of thyroid hormone economy in the CNS also utilizes a second deiodinase, type 3 deiodinase (D3), that inactivates thyroid hormone in neurons. In brain, the presence of type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) seems to be important to maintain homeostasis of T(3) levels. RT-PCR as well as Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of D3 mRNA in the cerebellum.

The iodothyronine deiodinases D1, D2, and D3 enable tissue-specific adaptation of thyroid hormone levels in response to various conditions, such as hypothyroidism or fasting. The possible expression of D2 mRNA in skeletal muscle is intriguing because this enzyme could play a role in systemic as well as local T3 production. Human skeletal muscle D2 mRNA expression is modulated by fasting and insulin, but not by hypothyroidism. The ratio of T3 production in cell sonicates (catalytic efficiency) was multiplied by the tissue activities reported in human liver (D1) and skeletal muscle (D2). SM had very low D2 activity and again no differences were found between groups; D3 activity in SM was higher in NTIS than controls. Deiodinase activities were then assayed in cell sonicates. "

Use of appropriate parenterally administered antibiotics, in combination with early surgical pericardial drainage or partial pericardiectomy, should minimize morbidity and mortality and prevent acute constrictive sequelae. We report successful treatment of a non-resolving fibrino-purulent pericardial effusion by combined intrapericardial irrigation of fibrinolytics and systemic corticosteroids administration as an alternative to pericardectomy. Although different causes of recurrent pericarditis have been identified, the etiology remains obscure in most cases which are therefore labelled as idiopathic. medical treatment may be changed in these patients with a slower tapering of the dosage of steroidal and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. A poor response to colchicine treatment and/or a steroid-dependence may be the clue to investigate TNFRSF1A mutations in patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. Prednisolone (20-30 mg/d) was used in addition to antituberculous chemotherapy in 11 of the 17 patients with effusive pericarditis. Standard treatment combines appropriate antibiotic therapy with surgical drainage. The incidence of purulent pericarditis has decreased considerably since the antibiotic era. Recurrences develop in up to 20-50% of patients with acute pericarditis. antibiotic therapy has been initiated. intravenous infusion of inotropic agents. "

      "ideal_answer": "Treatment consists in the use of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs and steroids in an isolated form or in combination. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping amiodarone treatment. the addition of lithium carbonate to the two other drugs resulted in a successful and safety therapy in controlling amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The disease course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is usually benign and remits with timely administration of anti-thyroid medications, with or without corticosteroids. lithium is a useful and safe medication for treatment of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis caused by amiodarone. Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued. RIT may be a safe and useful method of AIT therapy in patients with low RAIU, in whom other treatment methods are contraindicated. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT). good response to anti-thyroid drugs and steroid therapy. "

Treatment consisted of a one-week regimen containing a PPI twice daily, amoxicillin (A) 1 g twice daily and rifabutin (R) 300 mg once daily (PPI-AR). In regions of high clarithromycin resistance, such as France, sequential treatment or bismuth-containing quadruple therapies are replacing standard triple therapies for the first-line empirical treatment. four different strategies for prevention of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage: 1) test for H. pylori and treatment, if positive; 2) proton pump inhibitor maintenance; 3) no preventive treatment; 4) empirical H. pylori eradication immediately after bleeding. Pretreatment antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin and A was evaluated using a validated epsilometer test. In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, empirical treatment of H. pylori infection immediately after feeding is restarted is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing recurrent hemorrhage. olecular tests can be used to detect H. pylori and clarithromycin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance in gastric biopsies without necessitating culture. Chitosan microspheres with multiple Eudragit L100 cores were easily prepared by a new emulsification/coagulation encapsulating method. "

      "ideal_answer": "Although it is not known whether vertebrate NDC1 protein localizes to nuclear pores like its yeast counterpart, the human homologue contains three FG repeats in the C-terminus, a feature of many nuclear pore proteins. In vertebrates, the NPC has a mass of ∼125 MD and contains over 30 different proteins (nucleoporins), including two integral proteins (gp210 and POM121) that in part protrude into the lumenal space adjacent to the NPC and are thought to help tether the NPC to the pore membrane. POM121 is a single-pass transmembrane protein containing a small luminal domain of ∼50 amino acids, with the majority of the protein exposed to the nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic sides of the NE (Fig. 3 A). Each contains six transmembrane segments in its N-terminal half and has a large soluble C-terminal half of approximately 300 amino acids. To determine its intracellular localization at a higher resolution, we expressed NH2- and COOH-terminal GFP fusions of hNDC1 in HeLa cells (Fig. S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200601001/DC1). the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Typical of a multimembrane-spanning protein, hNDC1 migrates faster on SDS-gels than expected from its calculated molecular mass. "

      "ideal_answer": "In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16). At least eight different Atg8 orthologs belonging to two subfamilies (LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP) occur in mammalian cells, but their individual roles and modes of action are largely unknown. In mammals, several orthologs have been identified and are classed into two subfamilies: the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, referred to simply as the LC3 or GABARAP families. Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming autophagic membranes, have been identified. SQSTM1) was maintained with MAP1LC3ΔGly proteins but was lost with GABARAPΔGly proteins (Fig. 4c), raising the possibility that the two ATG8 sub-families have distinct lipidation requirements for assembly with particular binding partners. The proteins that make up the GABARAP family demonstrate conservation of their amino acid sequences and protein structures. The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes.

      "ideal_answer": "Ability to stimulate p53-dependent transcription was lost by C-terminal mutants of prothymosin alpha with impaired nuclear accumulation, but not by N-terminal deletion mutants and by the double mutant of prothymosin alpha with impaired ability to bind Keap1, suggesting that prothymosinalpha-Keap1 interaction is dispensable for p53 response. We found that zinc binding causes partial folding of the C-terminal half of ProTalpha, especially the Glu-rich region. fProt-alpha contains 28 aspartic and 25 glutamic acid residues and presents the typical basic KKQK amino acid sequence in the close carboxyl terminal region. These data, in conjunction with reports showing that the peptide TKKQKTDEDD is generated in vivo upon caspase-cleavage of ProTalpha during apoptosis, strengthen our hypothesis that immune response stimulation by ProTalpha is in principle exerted via its bioactive C-terminal decapaptide, which can acquire a sequence-specific beta-sheet conformation and induce DC maturation. Prothymosin alpha immunoactive carboxyl-terminal peptide TKKQKTDEDD stimulates lymphocyte reactions, induces dendritic cell maturation. When cells were administered apoptogenic compounds, ProTα was cleaved by caspase-3 to generate a C-terminal peptide-deficient fragment, which lacks the nuclear localization signal (NLS). "

      "ideal_answer": "The main contribution of this paper is a case-study demonstrating how an Aho-Corasick architecture and finite state machine (FSM) organization can be specifically optimized for incorporation into proteogenomic pipeline using field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. Examples include the use of FPGAs to improve the speed of homology search [18,19] for computing phylogenetic trees [20], for the pairwise alignment step in multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTALW [21], and for acceleration of the Smith-Waterman sequence alignment algorithm [18]. Sequences are aligned on the FPGA accelerator with a space-efficient dynamic programming algorithm and a traceback procedure. Most efforts to accelerate bio-sequence applications with hardware have focused solely on database searches and have employed a pairwise local comparison algorithm. An 8-lane PCI Express [35] add-in card with a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100 FPGA provides the hardware acceleration for pairwise alignment. We present a reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string matching and longest common subsequence. We describe how this technique leads to significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA). "
