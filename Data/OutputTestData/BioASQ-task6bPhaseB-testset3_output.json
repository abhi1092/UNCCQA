      "ideal_answer": "Guided growth for tibia vara (Blount\u0027s disease). Blount\u0027s disease is commonly attributed to an intrinsic, idiopathic defect in the posteromedial proximal tibial physis resulting in progressive bowing of the leg, intoeing, and lateral knee thrust. Blount\u0027s disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis. In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount\u0027s Disease). INTRODUCTION: In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount\u0027s disease. A LSG was done in a 10-year-old boy, body mass index (BMI) 42, who has Blount\u0027s disease (tibia vara) with severe pain at the knee joints that made him a wheelchair-bound person. Late-onset tibia vara or Blount\u0027s disease is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents. Blount\u0027s disease, or tibia vara, is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents. "

      "ideal_answer": "We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated \"bystander\" genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). "

This experience is referred to as King-Kopetzky syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory processing disorder (APD). Decreases in DPOAE level appear to represent evidence of minor cochlear pathology, and provide a pathological basis for the difficulty of hearing speech in the presence of background noise, which characterizes King-Kopetzky syndrome. It is characterized by normal hearing thresholds on pure tone audiometry (PTA) but complaints of difficulties in understanding speech in the presence of background noise. The principal symptom of subjects suffering from King-Kopetzky syndrome is a perceived difficulty in recognizing and understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. King Kopetzky Syndrome (KKS) is a common condition in which individuals with normal audiograms complain of hearing difficulties, particularly in noisy places. King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically normal hearing threshold. The main findings are that complaints were commonly focused on the categories of \u0027live speech\u0027 and \u0027electronic speech\u0027 difficulties in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome, particularly the auditory difficulties of speech in noise and group conversation.

Abdominal obesity is frequently associated with a collection of metabolic disorders that include elevated blood pressure, characteristic lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides) and increased fasting glucose, with an underlying situation of insulin resistance, which has been defined as metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease in women. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature mortality. MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia.

RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Cilengitide combined with metronomic temozolomide and procarbazine in MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma did not improve survival compared with historical data and does not warrant further investigation. . In CORE, higher αvβ3 levels in tumor cells were associated with improved progression-free survival by central review and with improved overall survival in patients treated with cilengitide. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin β3 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on GBM cells.

We found that nimotuzumab with or without radiotherapy, chemotherapy in newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), might improve the response rate or the survival time. Here, we describe the case of an 8-year-old girl with primary metastatic DIPG who received craniospinal radiotherapy, a local boost, and concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab treatment based on an individual therapy recommendation. Two patients lived 663 and 481 days from the start of nimotuzumab.CONCLUSIONS: Modest activity of nimotuzumab in DIPG, which has been shown previously, was confirmed: A small subset of DIPG patients appeared to benefit from anti-EGFR antibody treatment. Combining craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab therapy may slightly improve tumor control and overall survival. In conclusion, nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug with acceptable toxicity, and it may have promising value in the combination treatment. The nimotuzumab/vinorelbine combination was very well tolerated, with no acute side-effects. Targeted therapy protocols included radiation therapy along with treatment by erlotinib, cilengitide, or an association of nimotuzumab and vinblastine. "

We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. ith the increased toxicities associated with CPT-11 coupled with its unclear clinical significance, investigating the efficacy of vorinostat combined with bevacizumab alone may represent a more promising strategy to evaluate in the context of a phase II clinical trial. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, vorinostat sensitivity and resistance signatures could facilitate patient selection in future trials. LESSONS LEARNED: Combination regimen with bevacizumab (BEV) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. . On the basis of the results of this phase II study, further evaluation of the vorinostat-bortezomib combination in GBM patients in this dose and schedule is not recommended.

The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter\u0027s syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity. Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones.

OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment with efficacy in reducing self-harm behaviors in borderline personality disorder (BPD). CONCLUSION: This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation, whereby problems concerning social cognition, which are also characteristic of BPD, may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT). In conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after DBT in patients with BPD.

We provide evidence that DLX2 directly drives Gad1, Gad2, and Vgat expression, and show that mutants had reduced mIPSC amplitude. In addition, the mutants formed fewer GABAergic synapses on excitatory neurons and had reduced mIPSC frequency. Thus, Dlx1\u00262 coordinate key components of CIN postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival.

This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases α and δ carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. "

We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.

These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. "

We propose that this aberrant activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity, which lastingly impairs the information processing of cortical inputs in dentate gyrus, may participate in hippocampal-related cognitive deficits, such as those reported in patients with epilepsy. Within the hippocampal formation neuronal networks undergo major reorganization, including the sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus; they establish aberrant recurrent synapses between dentate granule cells and operate via postsynaptic kainate receptors. The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolism‑associated genes in recurrent neonatal seizure‑induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis.

Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, which encodes facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome: homozygosity for two novel and one recurrent SLC2A10 missense mutations in three families with severe cardiopulmonary complications in infancy and a literature review. Mutations in SLC2A10/GLUT10, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, are associated with altered transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS). Mutations in SLC2A10, a gene that encodes the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10, cause ATS. Approximately 100 ATS patients have been described, and 21 causal mutations have been identified in the SLC2A10 gene. ATS is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). "

This case report highlights the possible mechanisms for the bone loss in the setting of prolactinoma and the need for assessing bone health in such patients. An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status. OBJECTIVE: Patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia. RESULTS: Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. Osteoporosis has been noted to be an issue in postmenopausal women with prolactinomas. "

One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation, we have utilised a Click chemistry approach, where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach. Here we show how the Click-PEGylation technique can be used to interrogate the redox state of proteins. "

Associated Cardiac Diseases, i.e., Marfan\u0027s syndrome, ostium secundum atrial septal defect and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, are discussed, and a section on Treatment deals chiefly with prophylaxis for infective endocarditis and the management of arrhythmias and chest pain.

In this work, we focus on The Cancer Genome Atlas, a comprehensive archive of tumoral data containing the results of high-throughout experiments, mainly Next Generation Sequencing, for more than 30 cancer types.RESULTS: We propose TCGA2BED a software tool to search and retrieve TCGA data, and convert them in the structured BED format for their seamless use and integration. We also provide and maintain an automatically updated data repository with publicly available Copy Number Variation, DNA-methylation, DNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and RNA-seq (V1,V2) experimental data of TCGA converted into the BED format, and their associated clinical and biospecimen meta data in attribute-value text format. Data extraction and integration methods are becoming essential to effectively access and take advantage of the huge amounts of heterogeneous genomics and clinical data increasingly available. Furthermore, TCGA2BED extends TCGA data with information extracted from other genomic databases (i.e., NCBI Entrez Gene, HGNC, UCSC, and miRBase). Additionally, it supports the conversion in CSV, GTF, JSON, and XML standard formats. "

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab (AMG 157/MEDI9929), a human monoclonal antibody specific for the epithelial-cell-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), in patients whose asthma remained uncontrolled despite treatment with long-acting beta-agonists and medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids. We further show that the monoclonal antibody Tezepelumab partly exploits these principles to neutralize TSLP activity. "

      "ideal_answer": "JACUSA: site-specific identification of RNA editing events from replicate sequencing data. Intriguingly, JACUSA captures most A→I events from RRD comparisons of RNA sequencing data derived from Drosophila and HEK-293 data sets. We further validated JACUSA\u0027s performance by testing its ability to detect A→I events using sequencing data from a human cell culture experiment and publicly available RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. Our software JACUSA detects single nucleotide variants by comparing data from next-generation sequencing experiments (RNA-DNA or RNA-RNA). We present JACUSA, a versatile one-stop solution to detect single nucleotide variant positions from comparing RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA sequencing samples. JACUSA outperforms other algorithms in terms of the F measure, which combines precision and recall, in all benchmark scenarios. In practice, JACUSA shows higher recall and comparable precision in detecting A→I sites from RNA-DNA comparisons, while showing higher precision and recall in RNA-RNA comparisons. To this end, we performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of HEK-293 cells on samples with lowered activity of candidate RNA editing enzymes. JACUSA has a higher recall and comparable precision for detecting true editing sites in RDD comparisons of HEK-293 data. This performance margin is highest for the RNA-RNA comparison scenario. "

      "ideal_answer": "Since IL-5 plays an important role in the maturation, survival and migration of eosinophils, hence the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma, biotherapeutics targeting IL-5/IL-5Rα have been developed and/or marketed, including Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, and Benralizumab. BACKGROUND: Benralizumab is a humanised, anti-interleukin 5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that directly and rapidly depletes eosinophils, reduces asthma exacerbations, and improves lung function for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. . We investigated whether benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor that significantly reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations, was also effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in patients relying on oral glucocorticoids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia. However, there is research underway investigating interleukin-based monoclonal antibodies such as benralizumab, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody which is currently in phase III clinical development. These include monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 or IL-5 receptor alpha (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab), IL-13 (lebrikizumab and tralokinumab), IL-4 receptor alpha (dupilumab), IgE (omalizumab), and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tezepelumab) and small molecule therapies such as prostaglandin D2blockers (fevipiprant and timapiprant). Benralizumab is a humanized, afucosylated, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α, immunoglobulin G (IgG)1κ monoclonal antibody. "

      "ideal_answer": "CSEQ-SIMULATOR: A DATA SIMULATOR FOR CLIP-SEQ EXPERIMENTS. Some of these tools were specifically developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. In this work, we also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak calling. CLIP-Seq protocols such as PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP or iCLIP allow a genome-wide analysis of protein-RNA interactions. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis. For the processing of the resulting short read data, various tools are utilized. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. "

Aims The Gore REDUCE Clinical Study (REDUCE) aims to establish superiority of patent foramen ovale closure in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing the risk of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a PFO who had had a cryptogenic stroke, the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone; however, PFO closure was associated with higher rates of device complications and atrial fibrillation.

      "ideal_answer": "These analyses provide examples for the broad applicability of StereoGene for regulatory genomics. Representing the correlation as a function of the genome position, StereoGene outputs the local correlation track as part of the analysis. These features may represent high-throughput data mapped to reference genome or sets of genomic annotations in that reference genome. We observe the changes in the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types consistent with known biology and find a novel spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with donor splice sites and with poly(A) sites. We apply our method to numerous comparisons of ChIP-Seq datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE to demonstrate its wide applicability. Genomics features with similar genome-wide distributions are generally hypothesized to be functionally related, for example, colocalization of histones and transcription start sites indicate chromatin regulation of transcription factor activity. Therefore, statistical algorithms to perform spatial, genome-wide correlation among genomic features are required.Results:. Here, we propose a method, StereoGene, that rapidly estimates genome-wide correlation among pairs of genomic features. StereoGene: rapid estimation of genome-wide correlation of continuous or interval feature data. Correlations are computed among neighboring genomic positions using kernel correlation. "

      "ideal_answer": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine what gives rise to the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract perforation, and whether these specific air distributions can play a clinically meaningful role in the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation. Forty-two patients with 10 cases of proximal GI perforation and 32 cases of distal GI perforation were evaluated based on the CT findings of extraluminal air (which was subdivided into the CT-falciform ligament sign crossing the midline and scattered pockets of air), bowel wall thickening (\u003e8 mm in gastroduodenal wall,\u003e3 mm in the small bowel wall,\u003e6 mm in the caliber of the appendix and\u003e5 mm in the colonic wall), associated abscess formation, ascites and adjacent fat stranding. RESULTS: All specific air distributions were more frequently present in patients with gastroduodenal perforation than lower GI tract perforation, but only the falciform ligament sign was statistically significant (p\u003c0.05). Regardless of the perforation sites, the falciform ligament sign was present significantly more frequently with an increase in the amount of free air on multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; p\u003c0.001).
