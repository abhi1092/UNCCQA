      "ideal_answer": "Targeted localization of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 by the mitotic-exit network regulates cytokinesis in budding yeast. we identified a novel factor that we call Inn1, which associates with the contractile actomyosin ring at the end of mitosis and is needed for cytokinesis. Cyk3 acts in actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis by recruiting Inn1 to the yeast bud neck. Our data indicate that recruitment of the C2 domain of Inn1 to the contractile actomyosin ring is crucial for ingression of the plasma membrane during cytokinesis in budding yeast. Our data support a model in which the C2-domain of Inn1 acts in conjunction with Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of Chs2 during cytokinesis. We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis. Cdc14-dependent dephosphorylation of Inn1 contributes to Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation. We show that phosphorylation of Inn1 by Cdk1 partially perturbs the interaction of Inn1 with Cyk3 thereby reducing the levels of Cyk3 at the cell division site. Inn1 and Cyk3 regulate chitin synthase during cytokinesis in budding yeasts. "

      "ideal_answer": "coupling MCM2-7 to replicative polymerases is an important feature of the regulation of chromosome replication in eukaryotes, and highlight a key role for Ctf4 in this process. Drosophila Ctf4 is essential for efficient DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression. hCtf4 plays an essential role in DNA replication and its ability to stimulate the replicative DNA polymerases. In this report, interactions between human Ctf4 (hCtf4) and the replicative helicase containing the cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45)/minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (Mcm2-7)/Go, Ichi, Nii, and San (GINS) (CMG) proteins [human CMG (hCMG) complex] were examined. The Ctf4 protein has been shown to be a central member of the replication fork and links the replicative MCM helicase and DNA polymerase Î± primase. And-1/Ctf4 is therefore a new replication initiation factor that brings together the MCM2-7 helicase and the DNA pol alpha-primase complex, analogous to the linker between helicase and primase or helicase and polymerase that is seen in the bacterial replication machinery. it has been implicated as a member of a complex that promotes replication fork stability, the Fork Protection Complex (FPC), and as being important for sister chromatid cohesion.

      "ideal_answer": "Here we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks. We found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components. we show that the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex allows the MCM (minichromosome maintenance) helicase to interact with key regulatory proteins in large replisome progression complexes (RPCs) that are assembled during initiation and disassembled at the end of S phase. RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion. Others have found recently that the Mrc1 subunit of RPCs binds DNA polymerase epsilon, which synthesises the leading strand at DNA replication forks. Here, we show that the RPC associates with DNA polymerase alpha that primes each Okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. "

      "ideal_answer": "The coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) binds in vitro to c-myc mRNA and is thought to stabilize the mRNA and increase c-Myc protein abundance. Developmental regulation of CRD-BP, an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes c-myc mRNA in vitro. CRD-BP binds specifically to the coding region of c-myc mRNA and might stabilize c-myc mRNA in vitro by protecting it from endonucleolytic cleavage. These data suggest that c-myc mRNA is rapidly degraded unless it is (i) translated without pausing or (ii) protected by the CRD-BP when pausing occurs. Previous experiments identified a CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) that appears to protect the CRD from endonuclease cleavage. These results provide the first direct evidence that CRD-BP can indeed protect c-myc CRD cleavage initiated by an endoribonuclease. We previously isolated and characterized a coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) that might regulate c-myc mRNA post-transcriptionally. CRD-BP has been assigned a role in stabilizing c-myc mRNA by preventing its endonucleolytic cleavage. A cytoplasmic protein, the coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP), binds in vitro to the c- myc coding region instability determinant. The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) has high affinity for the coding region determinant (CRD) of c-myc mRNA. "

We consequently compared the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, which diverged about 200 million years ago, and identified 25 ultraconserved elements that are longer than 100 bp. Conservation and functional element discovery in 20 angiosperm plant genomes. Comparisons of orthologous maize-rice and maize-sorghum gene pairs identified 20 bp as a minimal length criterion for a significant CNS among grass genes, with few such CNS found to be conserved across rice, maize, sorghum, and barley. Surveys for conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) among genes from monocot cereal species were conducted to assess the general properties of CNS in grass genomes and their correlation with known promoter regulatory elements. Conserved noncoding sequences among cultivated cereal genomes identify candidate regulatory sequence elements and patterns of promoter evolution. The detailed view of conservation across angiosperms revealed not only high coding-sequence conservation but also a large set of previously uncharacterized intergenic conservation. Conserved noncoding sequences highlight shared components of regulatory networks in dicotyledonous plants. "

      "ideal_answer": "Moreover, the absence of Ctf4 and Chl1, but not of the other factors, causes a synthetic growth defect in cells lacking Eco1. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1. In addition to Eco1, several other factors contribute to cohesion establishment, including Ctf4, Ctf18, Tof1, Csm3, Chl1 and Mrc1, but little is known about their roles. Distinct from acetylation defects, sister chromatid cohesion in ctf4Î and chl1Î cells is not improved by removing Wapl. Here, we used Xenopus egg extracts to show that AND-1 and Tim1-Tipin, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctf4 and Tof1-Csm3, respectively, are associated with the replisome and are required for proper establishment of the cohesion observed in the M-phase extracts. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Constituents of the replication fork, such as the DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein Ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood. "

Ciona conserved non-coding elements (ciCNEs) are associated with largely the same key regulatory genes as vertebrate CNEs. Here we report that nematode genomes contain an alternative set of CNEs that share sequence characteristics, but not identity, with their vertebrate counterparts. CNEs thus represent a very unusual class of sequences that are extremely conserved within specific animal lineages yet are highly divergent between lineages. A core set of genes that regulate development is associated with CNEs across three animal groups (worms, flies and vertebrates). We have identified Conserved Non-coding Elements (CNEs) in the regulatory region of Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. "

      "ideal_answer": "The direct binding to streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. The identification of short peptide tags that are efficiently biotinylated by the bacterial BirA biotin ligase led to an approach for the single-step purification of transcription factor complexes by specific in vivo biotinylation tagging. We have described the application of a simple biotinylation tagging approach for the direct purification of tagged transcription factor complexes, based on the use of artificial short peptide tags that are specifically and efficiently biotinylated by the bacterial BirA biotin ligase, which is co-expressed in cells with the tagged factor. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. Using the biotin tagged erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 as example, we describe several optimization steps for the application of the high affinity biotin streptavidin system in ChIP. "

Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Our work describes, for the first time, distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. "

      "ideal_answer": "Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand. We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising protein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category. "

      "ideal_answer": "Using an unsupervised pattern-discovery method, we processed the human intergenic and intronic regions and catalogued all variable-length patterns with identically conserved copies and multiplicities above what is expected by chance. Discovery of pyknons, the most frequent, variable-length DNA sequence motifs in the human genomes, suggests extensive sequence-based connectivity between non-coding and protein-coding components of human genomes. Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 patterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes. Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA that also appear at least once among coding genes. these data reveal that pyknons represent a biologically important link between coding and non-coding DNA. In a recent paper in PNAS, Rigoutsos et al. (2006) describe a nonrandom pattern of repeated elements, called pyknons, which are found more frequently in the 3\u0027 untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome. Pyknons have only been discovered in the human genome, so it is unknown whether pyknons have wider biological relevance or are simply a phenomenon of the human genome. "

      "ideal_answer": "implants of DF cells in the presence of pulp cells led to the formation of bone-like tissues. These results suggest that the combined use of DF, HERS, and pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and/or osteoblasts in vivo, thus providing a novel strategy for the successful repair and regeneration of diseased periodontal tissue. Our results indicate that persistent stabilization of Ã-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to premature differentiation of odontoblasts and differentiation of cementoblasts, and induces excessive dentin and cementum formation in vivo. We demonstrated that while HERS cells are able to induce DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and promote cementum formation, pulp cells could direct DF cell differentiation into osteoblasts and enhance alveolar bone formation. These results suggest that temporospatial regulation of Wnt/Ã-catenin signaling plays critical roles in the differentiation of odontoblasts and cementoblasts, and that inhibition of Wnt/Ã-catenin signaling may be important for the formation of dentin and cementum during tooth development. Histological, immunohistochemical, and scanning electronic microscopy examinations results showed that bioengineered dentin could induce cementogenesis and PDL formation, and condense PDL arranged perpendicularly on the dentin surface via a layer of cementum-like tissue.

To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci). In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors. we review how Gfi1 and its paralogue Gfi1b control the development of blood cells, discuss how changes in Gfi1 and Gfi1b function contribute to hematological disease and report on the molecular function of these proteins. We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.

Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation. Here, we reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation regulates TAL1 interaction with the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) that removes methyl group from methylated Lys 4 on histone H3 tails. LSD1-mediated epigenetic modification is required for TAL1 function and hematopoiesis. we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1. the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. Histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) protein is involved in Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4)-mediated transcriptional repression in hematopoietic stem cells. "

The combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin shows similar efficacy in the treatment of platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Both gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are antineoplastic drugs with clinical activity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Gemcitabine and carboplatin demonstrate moderate toxicity with similar efficacy in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting reversal of platinum resistance by gemcitabine. the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin is now approved for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Gemcitabine and prolonged oral etoposide have shown reproducible single-agent activity in patients with platinum/paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. Gemcitabine is a novel agent that has shown consistent activity as a single agent in the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a favorable toxicity profile. A biweekly schedule of gemcitabine combined with PLD is an active and safe chemotherapy regimen with acceptable and easily manageable toxicities in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

To trace the history of non-coding elements, which may represent candidate ancestral cis-regulatory modules affirmed during chordate evolution, we have searched for conserved elements in tunicate and vertebrate (Olfactores) genomes. We have explored the distributions of fully conserved ungapped blocks in genome-wide pair-wise alignments of recently completed species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis. Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related Anopheles gambiae. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model. Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates. "

While replication of most of the yeast genome was not dependent upon Rrm3p, in its absence, replication forks paused and often broke at an estimated 1400 discrete sites, including tRNA genes, centromeres, inactive replication origins, and transcriptional silencers. Lack of the yeast Rrm3p DNA helicase causes replication defects at multiple sites within ribosomal DNA (rDNA), including at the replication fork barrier (RFB). Twice as many pause sites were identified in rrm3 compared with wild-type cells, as pausing in this strain occurred at both highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and the previously identified protein DNA complexes. The DNA helicase Rrm3 promotes replication fork progression through \u003e1000 discrete genomic regions and represses the cDNA-mediated mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon. Loss of Rrm3p also resulted in replication fork pausing at specific sites in subtelomeric DNA, such as at inactive replication origins, and at internal tracts of C(1-3)A/TG(1-3) DNA. ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are a class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cells. "

Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process. "

We propose that the regulatory elements spread across large regions on either side of Hox clusters are a major evolutionary constraint that has maintained the exceptionally long syntenic blocks at the HoxA and HoxD loci. Highly conserved syntenic blocks at the vertebrate Hox loci and conserved regulatory elements within and outside Hox gene clusters. The CNS include previously characterized enhancers and overlap with the 5\u0027 global control regions of HoxA and HoxD clusters. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. We further compared the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters, finding several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. "

      "ideal_answer": "A Phylogenomic Perspective on the Radiation of Ray-Finned Fishes Based upon Targeted Sequencing of Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs). Target capture and massively parallel sequencing of ultraconserved elements for comparative studies at shallow evolutionary time scales. We introduce a new class of molecular marker, anchored by ultraconserved genomic elements (UCEs), that universally enable target enrichment and sequencing of thousands of orthologous loci across species separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Analysis of the UCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep time-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and Lepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be the earliest diverging teleost lineages. Using species-tree analysis that accounts for discord among hundreds of independent loci, we show that this class of marker is useful for recovering deep-level phylogeny in placental mammals. Ultraconserved elements are novel phylogenomic markers that resolve placental mammal phylogeny when combined with species-tree analysis. Because orthologous UCEs can be obtained from a wide array of taxa, are polymorphic at shallow evolutionary timescales, and can be generated rapidly at low cost, they are an effective genetic marker for studies investigating evolutionary patterns and processes at shallow timescales.

      "ideal_answer": "This study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of DNA curvature, CpG islands and tandem repeats at the DNA sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants. Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes. Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of \"putative\" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants. In plant genomes, there exist discrete regions rich in CpG dinucleotides, namely CpG clusters. "

Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes. HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes. we review recent findings that disruptions of CNEs, within or at long distance from the coding sequences of key genes involved in NCC development, result in neurocristopathies via the alteration of tissue- or stage-specific long-distance regulation of gene expression. We show that human HCNEs result in expression patterns in zebrafish equivalent to those in mouse, establishing zebrafish as a suitable model for large-scale testing of human developmental enhancers.

Transvection in the bithorax-complex appears to result from the ability of cis-regulatory elements to regulate transcription of the promoter on the homologous chromosome. In addition, the findings, together with genetic studies in Drosophila, strongly suggest that enhancer action in trans could underlie phenomena such as \u0027transvection\u0027, where one chromosome affects gene expression in the paired homolog. A number of sites recognized by this protein fall within genes associated with transvection, a phenomenon suggesting a form of gene regulation that is responsive to the proximity of a gene to its homologous allele on another chromosome. Pairing-dependent interallelic complementation was first described for the Ultrabithorax gene of the bithorax-complex in Drosophila by Lewis and cited as an example of a new phenomenon that Lewis called the \"trans-vection effect.\".

The gene for the mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) was identified in the Escherichia coli genome as a sequence homolog of the human thymine DNA glycosylase with activity against mismatched uracil base pairs. The bacterial mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) and eukaryotic thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes form a homologous family of DNA glycosylases that initiate base-excision repair of G:U/T mismatches. The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U.G mismatches. The structure of this complex explains the preference for G:U over G:T mispairs, and reveals an essentially non-specific pyrimidine-binding pocket that allows MUG/TDG enzymes to excise the alkylated base, 3, N(4)-ethenocytosine. the principal role of Mug in E. coli may be to help repair damage to DNA caused by exogenous chemical agents such as chloroacetaldehyde. The latter activity is missing in extracts from mug cells, suggesting that Mug may be the only enzyme in E. coli that can remove this mutagenic adduct.

Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named \u0027hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts\u0027 (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n\u003d283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia. Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis.

      "ideal_answer": "The recognition by Escherichia coli Uvr nucleotide excision repair proteins of a variety of lesions with diverse chemical structures and the presence of helicase activity in the UvrAB complex which can displace short oligonucleotides annealed to single-stranded DNA led to a model in which this activity moves UvrAB along undamaged DNA to damaged sites where the lesion blocks further translocation and the protein-DNA pre-incision complex is formed. Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair (NER) is responsible for removing bulky DNA adducts by dual incisions of the UvrABC endonuclease. This protein recruits the NER lesion-recognition factor UvrA, and then dissociates from the DNA. the activity of the UvrAB complex which can induce DNA conformational change is employed in NER. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that acts specifically on lesions in the transcribed strand of expressed genes. UvrB plays a key role in bacterial nucleotide excision repair. UvrAB complex suppresses illegitimate recombination. the transcription repair coupling factor, Mfd. UvrA binds UvrB, and the assembled UvrAB* complex initiates repair. It is the ultimate damage-binding protein that interacts with both UvrA and UvrC. UvrB subunits bind to UvrA, most likely as part of a UvrA2B2 complex. "

      "ideal_answer": "In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. CSB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. "

PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade. Bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of DNA replication encode two DNA polymerases III, DnaE and PolC, rather than a single one. PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE.

There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation). in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival.

M6P receptors play a major role in the intracellular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in mammalian cells. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) mediates sorting of lysosomal hydrolase precursors from the TGN to endosomes. The majority of the enzymes leave the TGN after modification with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues, which are specifically recognized by M6P receptors (MPRs), ensuring their transport to the endosomal/lysosomal system. delivery of mannose 6-phosphate receptors carrying lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal system. certain soluble lysosomal hydrolases, is sorted and trafficked to the lysosomes by sortilin.

Among them, the two that are mediated by the M6P alternative receptors, lysosomal integral membrane protein (LIMP-2) and sortilin, have gained unequivocal support. Recently, the multi-ligand receptor sortilin has also been implicated in this transport. "

Promising results have been found in studies of the drug as monotherapy, and oxaliplatin may also prove useful in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with unresectable liver metastases; however, data are limited at present. Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound, has been commonly used around the world for treating advanced colorectal cancer. The oxaliplatin monotherapy dose schedule of 130 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, recommended worldwide, is acceptable for Japanese patients. It appears to be particularly advantageous (in terms of response rate and duration of progression-free survival) when used in combination with fluorouracil/calcium folinate as both a first- and second-line option, although preliminary studies have failed to show any survival advantage over fluorouracil/calcium folinate alone. oxaliplatin is a promising treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      "ideal_answer": "We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence. Our method integrates a novel feature in transmembrane protein topology prediction, which results in improved performance for topology prediction and reliable prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. We report a relative improvement of 13% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides. We present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. MetaTM is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six TM topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. "

These data were enriched and organised in order to populate LepChorionDB, the first relational database, available on the web, containing Lepidopteran chorion proteins grouped in A and B classes. LepChorionDB may provide insights in future functional and evolutionary studies of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and thus, it will be a useful tool for the Lepidopteran scientific community and Lepidopteran genome annotators, since it also provides access to the two pHMMs developed in this work, which may be used to discriminate A and B class chorion proteins. A database, named LepChorionDB, was constructed by searching 5 different protein databases using class A and B central domain-specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), developed in this work. A total of 413 Lepidopteran chorion proteins from 9 moths and 1 butterfly species were retrieved. "

The TM topologies in TMPDB were determined experimentally by means of X-ray crystallography, NMR, gene fusion technique, substituted cysteine accessibility method, N-linked glycosylation experiment and other biochemical methods. TMPDB release 6.2 contains a total of 302 TM protein sequences, in which 276 are alpha-helical sequences, 17 beta-stranded, and 9 alpha-helical sequences with short pore-forming helices buried in the membrane. TMPDB would be useful as a test and/or training dataset in improving the proposed TM topology prediction methods or developing novel methods with higher performance, and as a guide for both the bioinformaticians and biologists to better understand TM proteins. It contains information collected from studies in the literature that report the use of biochemical methods for the determination of the topology of Î±-helical transmembrane proteins. Topological information is combined with transmembrane topology prediction resulting in more reliable topological models. ExTopoDB: a database of experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane proteins. ExTopoDB is a publicly accessible database of experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane proteins. "

The sequences of five other families of repeats, MER41, MER48, MER50, MER51, and RMER3, resemble long terminal repeats of retroviruses. We report eleven new families of MEdium Reiteration frequency (MER) interspersed repeats in the genomes of Primates, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha. While a large majority of genomic sites with high ChIP-seq signal is associated with a nucleotide sequence resembling a STAT1 binding site, only a very small subset of the over 5 million potential STAT1 binding sites in the human genome is covered by ChIP-seq data. The observation of the binding of activated STAT1 protein to a specific repetitive element bolsters similar reports concerning p53 and other TFs, and strengthens the notion of an involvement of repeats in gene regulation. On a methodological aspect, the presence of large numbers of nearly identical binding sites in repetitive sequences may lead to wrong conclusions about intrinsic binding preferences of TF as illustrated by the spacing analysis STAT1 tandem motifs. Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence that STAT1 binds to multiple distinct motifs upon interferon-gamma stimulation in vivo. "

The Ada protein acts both as a positive regulator of the response and as a DNA repair enzyme, correcting premutagenic O6-alkylguanine in DNA by suicidal transfer of the alkyl group to one of its own cysteine residues. The Escherichia coli Ada and Ogt DNA methyltransferases (MTases) are known to transfer simple alkyl groups from O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine, directly restoring these alkylated DNA lesions to guanine and thymine. O6-Methylguanine is removed from DNA via the transfer of the methyl group to a cysteine acceptor site present in the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. compared with the wild type, stationary populations of the MTase-deficient E. coli (under lactose selection) displayed increased G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions (10- and 3-fold, respectively) and increased G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions (10-, 2.5-, and 1.7-fold, respectively). During exponential growth, the spontaneous rate of G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to C:G transversions was elevated about fourfold in ada ogt double mutant versus wild-type E. coli. "

AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, is structurally homologous to endo III. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two paralogues of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, Mag1p and Mag2p, which share homology with Escherichia coli AlkA. Escherichia coli alkA tagA double mutants, which are deficient in the repair of alkylated bases. Using this motif as a protein database searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions. We have now identified a shared active site motif amongst these three proteins. To clarify the function of these redundant enzymes in base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage. Alkylation damage is removed by the action of DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway. "

The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (\u003e\u003e300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content. Vertebrate genomes are comprised of isochores that are relatively long (\u003e100 kb) regions with a relatively homogenous (either GC-rich or AT-rich) base composition and with rather sharp boundaries with neighboring isochores. Isochores are large regions of relatively homogeneous nucleotide composition. "

When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is expected to be A \u003d T and G \u003d C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v [from an A-T or T-A nucleotide pair (AT-pair) to a G-C or C-G nucleotide pair (GC-pair)] and u [from a GC-pair to an AT-pair], are usually not the same. The net effect, v/(u + v), has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in bacteria. Directional mutation theory predicts that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately after the mutator mutation takes place.

      "ideal_answer": "In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands. genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. "

These analyses include finding the dnaA gene and its binding sites; making BLAST analyses of the intergenic sequences compared to related species; studying the gene order around the origin sequence; and studying the distribution of the genes encoded in the leading versus the lagging strand. In silico comparative analysis of sequenced mollicute genomes indicated the lack of conservation of gene order in the region containing the predicted origin of replication (oriC) and the existence, in most of the mollicute genomes examined, of putative DnaA boxes lying upstream and downstream from the dnaA gene.

Genomic homogeneity is investigated for a broad base of DNA sequences in terms of dinucleotide relative abundance distances (abbreviated delta-distances). delta-distances between different genomic sequences in the same species are low, only about 2 or 3 times the distance found in random DNA, and are generally smaller than the between-species delta-distances. the set of dinucleotide odds ratios or \u0027general design\u0027 is a remarkably stable property of the DNA of an organism. The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows on a given genome.

      "ideal_answer": "Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. Furthermore, we show that Gfi-1B includes a KSKK motif in its SNAG domain, which recruits the repressor complex only when dimethylated on lysine 8. Mutation of lysine 8 prevents Gfi-1B p32-induced erythroid development. Gfi-1B p32 isoform binds to Gfi-1B target gene promoters and associates with the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex more efficiently than the major Gfi-1B p37 isoform. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Consistent with the dual roles of TAL1 in transcription, TAL1-associated LSD1 is decreased while recruitment of hSET1 is increased at the TAL1 targets during erythroid differentiation. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs.

Phycoerythrin is a major light-harvesting pigment of red algae and cyanobacteria widely used as a fluorescent probe. An extensive range of pigments including phycobiliproteins are present in algae. B-Phycoerythrin (B-PE) is a major light-harvesting pigment of microalgae. In this paper, B-phycoerythrin and R-phycocyanin in native state, from the red alga Porphyridium cruentum were obtained by an inexpensive and simple process. R-phycoerythrin was isolated and purified from a red alga, Polysiphonia urceolata Grev. The purified protein had three absorption peaks at 498, 535, and 565 nm and displayed a fluorescence maximum at 580 nm, which was consistent with the typical spectrum of R-phycoerythrin. Phycobiliproteins are derived from the photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. R-phycoerythrin is the major light-harvesting pigment protein of most red algal phycobilisomes.

POR complex assembly (including LHPP and POR dimers) did not affect the formation of prolamellar bodies (PLBs) that function for efficient capture of light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms an aggregate of photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes localized to the prolamellar bodies within etioplasts. The content of the supramolecular light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase:protochlorophyllide) and the density of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts are decreased in the mutant. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts. Etioplasts that develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark contain a highly organized lipid structure termed prolamellar body (PLB), which is the main site of accumulation of the ternary Pchlide:POR:NADPH complexes. This resulted in the recovery of thylakoid membrane stacking in chloroplasts in the light, and the formation of prolamellar bodies and plastoglobuli in etioplasts in the dark. "

In this model, the stromal fibroblasts would undergo aerobic glycolysis (a.k.a., the Warburg effect)--producing and secreting increased pyruvate/lactate that could then be used by adjacent epithelial cancer cells as \"fuel\" for the mitochondrial TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the \"Reverse Warburg Effect,\" as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer cells. In this model, \"energy transfer\" or \"metabolic-coupling\" between the tumor stroma and epithelial cancer cells \"fuels\" tumor growth and metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in anabolic cancer cells.

We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a. In this study, we have identified CNEs in human, dog, chicken, Xenopus, and four teleost fishes (zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and fugu) using elephant shark, a cartilaginous vertebrate, as the base genome and investigated the evolution of these ancient vertebrate CNEs (aCNEs) in bony vertebrate lineages. After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. This implicates the \"fish-specific\" whole-genome duplication in the accelerated evolution and the loss of a large number of both copies of duplicated CNEs in teleost fishes. We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved synteny across vertebrate genomes. "

These early data point to the usefulness of gene expression profiling techniques in the identification of subclasses of periodontitis with common pathobiology. A total of 14 patients, seven with chronic and seven with aggressive periodontitis, were examined with respect to clinical periodontal status, composition of subgingival bacterial plaque assessed by checkerboard hybridizations, and levels of serum IgG antibodies to periodontal bacteria assayed by checkerboard immunoblotting. In addition, at least two pathological pockets/patient were biopsied, processed for RNA extraction, amplification and labeling, and used to study gene expression using Affymetrix U-133 A arrays. Based on a total of 35 microarrays, no significantly different gene expression profiles appeared to emerge between chronic and aggressive periodontitis. These two groups had similar clinical periodontal status and subgingival bacterial profiles, but differed significantly with respect to serum IgG levels against the important periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Campylobacter rectus.

An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5\u0027 ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. We found that 11% of the conserved noncoding DNA consists of predicted MARs. Conversely, more than half of the predicted MARs co-occur with one or more independently identified conserved sequence blocks. We hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, MARs (or S/MARs). "

      "ideal_answer": "At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix, coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal globule conformation. The fractal globule, a self-similar compact polymer conformation where the chain is spatially segregated on all length scales, has been proposed to result from a sudden polymer collapse. Additionally, the strings and binders switch model reproduces the recently proposed \"fractal-globule\" model, but only as one of many possible transient conformations. Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10Â Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. "

These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. High-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). spontaneous mutation rate is directly proportional to the transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es). Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. High levels of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA damage. Transcription-associated mutagenesis in yeast is directly proportional to the level of gene expression. Here, we describe a pGAL-CAN1 forward mutation assay for studying transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in yeast. "

The mechanism of a CsA-induced fibroblast overgrowth may converge on the steps involving fibroblast proliferation and cytokine network including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1Î², TGF-Î²1, and PGE2, in both adults and pediatrics. Although the mechanism by which the drugs cause GO is not yet understood, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which is a potent epithelial cell mitogen, has been implicated in other hyperplastic conditions, including mammary and prostatic hyperplasia, and could also be involved in the molecular pathology of GO. The immunosuppressant and hyperplasia-inducing drug cyclosporin A regulates the cell cycle and cyclin B1 gene expression in gingival fibroblasts in vitro. Although the precise mechanism is not yet known, the enhanced proliferation of gingival fibroblasts observed in this disease could be caused at least partly by the effects of the drugs on the cell cycle and cyclin expression in these cells.

Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p \u003c 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide. Among the human studies, two studies reported that EMD is a more efficient DPC procedure compared with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 ). All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposure. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. "

      "ideal_answer": "We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. "

The random breakage and variants keeping genome size and chromosome number independent raise no serious objection to the relevance of correlations consistent with Menzerath-Altmann law across taxonomic groups and the possibility of a connection between human language and genomes through that law.

      "ideal_answer": "Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairs. active polymerases cluster into replication and transcription \"factories\" in both pro- and eukaryotes. Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei. in proliferating cells, there is evidently a correlation between radial positioning and gene density.

      "ideal_answer": "We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. "

      "ideal_answer": "Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer. Over-expressing CYLD augments antitumor activity of TRAIL by inhibiting the NF-ÎºB survival signaling in lung cancer cells. increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF-ÎºB activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF-ÎºB activity. Deletion of exon 9 would cause a carboxyl-terminal truncation of CYLD and inactivation of its deubiquitinating activity. In accordance with previous studies, fibroblasts from Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) embryos had hyperactive nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun kinase pathways compared with control fibroblasts. Histological examination of E18.5 Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) lungs demonstrated an immature phenotype characterized by hyperplasic mesenchyme but apparently normal epithelial, smooth muscle. Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) newborn mice were smaller than wild-type littermates with a short and kinky tail and no major developmental defects. However, Cyld(Delta 9/Delta 9) mice died shortly after birth from apparent respiratory dysfunction. "

      "ideal_answer": "Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner. Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane.

      "ideal_answer": "The control region proved to be a less useful molecular marker for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa in A. urticae than it has for other species. Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic signal) and \"false\" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy). This added level of homoplasic \"noise\" can make DNA regions with repeats less reliable in phylogenetic reconstruction than those without repeats. Minimal homoplasy (consistency index \u003d 0.9591) was detected among parsimony-informative SNPs, allowing for the generation of a highly accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of the CC398 clonal lineage. Computational and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only some BH3 motifs arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (homology), whereas others arose by convergent evolution or random coincidence (homoplasy). Taxa that experienced molecular homoplasy, recent selection, a spur of evolution, and so forth may disrupt the inference and cause incongruences in the estimated phylogeny. These findings provide evidence for the occurrence of a high degree of homoplasy in the DR locus leading to convergent evolution to identical spoligotypes. "

      "ideal_answer": "The presence of evolutionary rate variation is an informative signal that often marks functional regions of genomes and historical selection events. One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. There is widespread evidence of lineage-specific rate variation, known as heterotachy, during protein evolution. Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. Here, we examine how the violation of homotachy (i.e., presence of within-site rate variation, called heterotachy) distorts species phylogenies. It has been proposed that the positions that show switches in substitution rate over time--i.e., \u0027heterotachous sites\u0027--are good indicators of functional divergence. These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). homotachy (i.e., the evolutionary rates within lineages in each of the concatenated genes are constant during evolution).

Altogether, our data strongly support a scenario in which microsporidia is the earliest-diverging clade of sequenced fungi. Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi. Phylogenomics supports microsporidia as the earliest diverging clade of sequenced fungi.

Nucleotide excision repair consists of excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold. "

      "ideal_answer": "Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility. Dysarthria affects linguistic domains such as respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance and prosody due to upper motor neuron, lower motor neuron, cerebellar or extrapyramidal tract lesions. There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. Acoustic analysis provides objective quantitative measures of speech that enable a comprehensive and accurate understanding of motor disorders and complement the traditional measures. The objective of this study is to evaluate phonation in ataxic dysarthria and a control group of normal speakers. Dysprosody is a common feature in speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria. "

      "ideal_answer": "Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Replication starts at a single Ori site in bacteria, but in eukaryotes multiple Ori sites are used for fast copying across all chromosomes. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified. The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and others have multiple origins of replication. Results from this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of replication. Although several in silico analyses have suggested that some archaeal species might contain more than one origin, this has only been demonstrated recently. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. "

The mechanism of reflex pupillary dilation was investigated in eight patients who were declared brain dead after rupture of intracranial vascular malformations and in eight awake volunteers. The sympathetic nervous system acts either directly on the dilator muscle (peripherally) or centrally by inhibiting the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. Pupil size is determined by an interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. activation of autonomic sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracic spinal cord produces pupillary dilatation. Sympathetic nervous system activation, with reflex dilation of the pupil. sympathetic responses (sweating, pupil dilatation, piloerection, etc.).

Prevention and correction of oxidative DNA lesions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ensured by the DNA oxidative repair system (GO).

Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. The common substrate structure for the functionally diverse Nudix protein superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. Escherichia coli mutT strains, deficient in the activity hydrolysing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u0027-deoxyguanosine 5\u0027-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), display more than a 100-fold higher spontaneous mutation frequency over the wild-type strain.

Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The hfq mutations were beneficial, deleterious or neutral at an intermediate growth rate (0.5âh(-1)) and one changed from beneficial to deleterious within a 36âmin difference in doubling time. Mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy. Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Indirect evidence suggested that some negative genetic correlations were due to antagonistic pleiotropy. Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. "

      "ideal_answer": "Population bottlenecks can have major effects in the evolution of RNA viruses, but their possible influence in the evolution of DNA viruses is largely unknown. The accumulation of deleterious mutations of a population directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist, a process often described as Muller\u0027s ratchet with the absorbing phenomenon. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is driven by rare fluctuations that lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as Muller\u0027s ratchet. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller\u0027s ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. Some arboviruses that infect both a mosquito vector and a mammalian host are known to experience population bottlenecks in their vectors, which may constrain their genetic diversity and could potentially lead to extinction events via Muller\u0027s ratchet. Primary bacterial endosymbionts of insects (p-endosymbionts) are thought to be undergoing the process of Muller\u0027s ratchet where they accrue slightly deleterious mutations due to genetic drift in small populations with negligible recombination rates.
