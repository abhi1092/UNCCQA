      "ideal_answer": "In addition, BBE and Fisher syndrome, which are clinically similar and are both associated with the presence of the immunoglobulin G anti-GQ1b antibody, represent a specific autoimmune disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms that include ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. The syndrome defined by Bickerstaff of progressive, external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, with disturbance of consciousness or hyperreflexia, has subsequently been associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies. An anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome has been proposed to underlie the common pathophysiology for the three disorders; however, other studies have found a positive anti-GM1 instead of anti-GQ1b antibody. However, contrary to a proposed anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome, we would suggest that pathogenesis of this clinical spectrum is not limited to anti-ganglioside antibodies. Serologic analysis of antibodies against ganglioside complexes (anti-GDIa, anti-GDIb, anti-GM1, anti-GM2, anti-GM3, anti-GQIb and anti-GTIb antibodies) showed negative results. Although there are usually no abnormalities in MFS by routine neuroimaging, in a few cases, contrast enhancement of nerve roots and signs of central nervous system involvement were described supporting the hypothesis of an anti-GQ1b-syndrome, a continuum involving GBS, MFS, and Bickerstaff\u0027s brainstem encephalitis.

      "ideal_answer": "These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions. Here we employ 5\u0027 and 3\u0027 deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the atxA control region to demonstrate that atxA transcription from the major start site P1 is dependent upon a consensus sequence for the housekeeping sigma factor SigA and an A+T-rich upstream element for RNA polymerase. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved in regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA are important for optimal toxin gene expression. The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively. AtxA controls the expression of more than a hundred genes belonging to all genetic elements, the chromosome and both virulence plasmids, including those encoding the major virulence factors. We also show that an additional trans-acting protein(s) binds specifically to atxA promoter sequences located between -13 and +36 relative to P1 and negatively impacts transcription. "

      "ideal_answer": "Non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation. The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. In recent years, technical advances in the molecular analysis of fetal DNA (e.g., digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing (MPS)) has enabled the successful implementation of noninvasive testing into clinical practice, such as fetal sex assessment, RhD genotyping, and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future. This review briefly summarizes the technical aspects of the NIPT and application of NIPT in clinical practice. "

      "ideal_answer": "Antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy is a promising therapeutic approach that uses short DNA-like molecules called antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to skip over/splice out the mutated part of the gene to produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD. many DMD patients need exon skipping of multiple exons in order to restore the reading frame, depending on how many base pairs the mutated exon(s) and adjacent exons have. Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively. Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle. "

Screening for NKX2-1 mutations in patients with thyroid, lung, and neurological abnormalities will enable a unifying diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected families. In addition, identification of an NKX2-1 defect would be helpful in allaying the concerns about inadequate thyroxine supplementation as the cause of neurological defects observed in some children with congenital hypothyroidism. The third patient without any identified NKX2-1 mutations was a carrier of mitochondrial mutation; this raises the possibility of mitochondrial mutations contributing to thyroid dysgenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 were identified in 2 cases selected on the basis of a BLT-like phenotype among 183 hypothyroid infants. Loss-of-function mutations in NKX2.1, a gene vital to the normal development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid, have been identified in a number of individuals. Genetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in two patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb deletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient.

      "ideal_answer": "Here we report that bioinformatic analyses suggested the presence in AtxA of two PTS (phosphenolpyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system) regulation domains (PRD) generally regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at conserved histidine residues. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes. data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins. The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2. Regulation of anthrax toxin activator gene (atxA) expression in Bacillus anthracis: temperature, not CO2/bicarbonate, affects AtxA synthesis. Upon infection of a mammalian host, Bacillus anthracis responds to host cues, and particularly to elevated temperature (37°C) and bicarbonate/CO2 concentrations, with increased expression of virulence factors that include the anthrax toxins and extracellular capsular layer.

Within mdx mice, an animal model of DMD, adipose tissue-derived Flk-1(+) MSCs (AD-MSCs) homed to and differentiated into cells that repaired injured muscle tissue. Purified iMSCs displayed fibroblast-like morphology, formed three-dimensional spheroid structures, and expressed characteristic mesenchymal stem cell surface markers such as CD29, CD33, CD73, CD90, and CD105. Flk-1+ adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into skeletal muscle satellite cells and ameliorate muscular dystrophy in mdx mice. This repair correlated with reconstitution of dystrophin expression on the damaged fibers. Flk-1(+) AD-MSC transplants may repair muscular dystrophy. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of purified iMSCs in skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice. Moreover, iMSCs were capable of differentiating into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. "

Our results showed that OC induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis by triggering a series of events in HeLa cells including Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, chromosome fragmentation followed by caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and eventually cell death. Moreover, overexpression of ERβ prevented Bax activation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage during apoptosis. Once activated, BAK and BAX form proteolipid pores in the OMM leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and the release of inner membrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c, which promotes caspase activation. In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 infection altered Bax conformation and triggered its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria in RD cells. associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Bax plays a key role in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol. "

Mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive growth disorder caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding a protein of unknown function. To investigate the possible involvement of TRIM37 alterations in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas, we analyzed the TRIM37 cDNA for mutations and alternatively spliced transcripts and TRIM37 expression in fibrothecomas of women without Mulibrey nanism. In conclusion, inherited biallelic inactivation of TRIM37 (Mulibrey nanism) predisposes to both mesenchymal and epithelial ovarian tumors and dysregulation of TRIM37 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas. It is caused by recessive mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding for the peroxisomal TRIM37 protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity. Gynecological tumors in Mulibrey nanism and role for RING finger protein TRIM37 in the pathogenesis of ovarian fibrothecomas.

The antimycobacterial activities of RS-112997, RS-124922 and RS-118641, three capuramycin analogues that inhibit phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase, were tested against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare. These results suggest that capuramycin analogues exhibit strong antimycobacterial potential and should be considered for further evaluation in the treatment of M. tuberculosis and M. avium-M. In comparison, the goal of treating M avium complex in patients with advanced HIV disease is to reduce constitutional symptoms and improve survival. The MIC50/90 (mg/L) results for RS-118641 were: M. tuberculosis, 1/2; multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, 0.5/2; M. avium, 4/8; and M. intracellulare, 0.06/0.5.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most frequent inherited cerebellar ataxia in Europe, the US and Japan, leading to disability and death through motor complications. Although the affected protein ataxin-3 is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding ataxin-3. Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiqutinating enzyme with important functions in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway and regulation of transcription. "

RESULTS: In our cohort of 159 patients with various craniosynostosis syndromes, mutations were found in 100% of patients with Apert syndrome, 83.3% with Pfeiffer syndrome, 72.7% with Crouzon syndrome, 50.0% with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, 27.7% with plagiocephaly, 31.8% with brachicephaly, 20% of complex cases, and 6.9% of mixed cases. FGFR genes have important effects on bone development, and mutations in 4 \"hot spot\" exons of FGFR1-3 are found in many patients with craniosynostosis and some with synostotic plagiocephaly. Mutations were found in eight of 47 patients: two patients with different single-amino-acid changes in FGFR2, three patients with FGFR3 Pro250Arg, and three patients with TWIST mutations. The most common mutation for achondroplasia (FGFR3 Gly380Arg, resulting in 1138G\u003eA) was identified. FGFR mutations and plagiocephaly. Mutation analyses in the FGFR3 gene revealed nucleotide alterations located in the mutational hot spot at amino acid residue 250 (g.C749). Other abnormalities in the craniofacial region and extremities were clues to a particular mutation in FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, or the X-linked mutation. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. "

      "ideal_answer": "Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome. Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features. ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage. The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence.

The expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. exon skipping may be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5 (CMTX5), Arts syndrome, and non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2) are allelic syndromes, caused by reduced activity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) due to loss-of-function mutations in PRPS1. Our findings demonstrate that CMTX5, Arts syndrome and DFN2 are phenotypic clusters on an intrafamilial continuum, including overlapping phenotypes even within individuals. Mutations in PRPS1 are associated with a spectrum of non-syndromic to syndromic hearing loss. Gain of function mutations in PRPS1 cause a superactivity of the PRS-I protein whereas the loss-of-function mutations result in X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness type 2 (DFN2), or in syndromic deafness including Arts syndrome and X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5). The respective phenotypic presentation seems to be determined by the exact PRPS1 mutation and the residual enzyme activity, the latter being largely influenced by the degree of skewed X-inactivation.

      "ideal_answer": "Mutations in the CHCHD10 gene have been recently identified in a large family with a complex phenotype variably associating frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, and hearing impairment. The observation of a frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype in a mitochondrial disease led us to analyse CHCHD10 in a cohort of 21 families with pathologically proven frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. During the preparation of this article other mutations were reported to cause frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis syndrome, indicating that the CHCHD10 gene is largely important for the motor and cognitive neuronal systems. Late onset spinal motor neuronopathy is caused by mutation in CHCHD10. Mutation in the novel nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 in a family with autosomal dominant mitochondrial myopathy. Our findings identify a novel gene causing mitochondrial myopathy, thereby expanding the spectrum of mitochondrial myopathies caused by nuclear genes. Mutation c.197G\u003eT p.G66V in CHCHD10 is the cause of the lower motor neuron syndrome LOSMoN/SMAJ. We identified the same missense p.Ser59Leu mutation in one of these families. "

      "ideal_answer": "Protein phosphatase 1 recruitment by Rif1 regulates DNA replication origin firing by counteracting DDK activity. Rif1 controls DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 to reverse Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of the MCM complex. These data reveal that human Rif1 contributes to the ATM-mediated protection against DNA damage and point to a remarkable difference in the primary function of this protein in yeast and mammals. Depletion of Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing domain structures. Rif1 binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins activated in rif1Δ. However, previous studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1\u0027s role in controlling replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S. cerevisiae genome. "

Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds demonstrated native-appearing cartilaginous growth that respected the boundaries of the scaffold.CONCLUSION: Integrated, image-based CAD and 3D printing processes generated patient-specific nasal and auricular scaffolds that supported cartilage regeneration. As a proof of concept, we generated a bionic ear via 3D printing of a cell-seeded hydrogel matrix in the anatomic geometry of a human ear, along with an intertwined conducting polymer consisting of infused silver nanoparticles. This allowed for in vitro culturing of cartilage tissue around an inductive coil antenna in the ear, which subsequently enables readout of inductively-coupled signals from cochlea-shaped electrodes. The printed ear exhibits enhanced auditory sensing for radio frequency reception, and complementary left and right ears can listen to stereo audio music. Auricular and nasal constructs with several types of microporous architecture were rapidly manufactured with high fidelity to human patient anatomy. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth. "

Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant. The present study shows that a number of basic antifungal peptides, including human salivary histatin 5, a designed histatin analog designated dhvar4, and a peptide from frog skin, PGLa, are active against amphotericin B-resistant Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Aspergillus fumigatus strains and against a fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata isolate. Assessment of the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5 with the well-characterized azole-resistant strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata, however, suggested that the mode of action of histatins against Candida is distinct from that of azole-based antifungal agents because Hsn-5 kills both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains equally well. Histatin 5, a human salivary protein with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, is remarkably ineffective against Candida glabrata. Since Hst 5 requires fungal binding to cell wall components prior to intracellular translocation, reduced Hst 5 binding to C. glabrata may be the reason for its insensitivity. "

CMT type 1 (CMT1; MIM 118200) is a group of autosomal dominant-inherited demyelinating neuropathies with a disease onset at or after childhood. Among them, CMT1A (MIM #118220) is most common and is usually associated with a duplication of a 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2,. Mutations in the NF-L gene (NEFL) cause autosomal dominant neuropathies that are classified either as axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 2E (CMT2E) or demyelinating CMT type 1F (CMT1F). Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B. GJB1 is currently considered to be associated with X-linked DI-CMT, and MPZ, INF2, DNM2, YARS, GNB4, NEFL, and MFN2 are associated with autosomal DI-CMT. Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, LITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI and a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also cause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria). Mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin 2 cause dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. "

      "ideal_answer": "Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes assembled by intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and they initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens and danger signals by activating caspase-1 (ref. e activation of inflammasome by different stimuli triggers the proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase 1 into active caspase 1. Formation of the inflammasome can lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases, such as Caspase-1, which then activate pro-inflammatory cytokines by proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, engagement of various PRR in the recently identified inflammasome complexes lead to activation of a cysteine protease, caspase-1. Although it is conventionally regarded as an inflammatory caspase, recent studies have shown that caspase-4 plays a role in induction of apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study demonstrates that caspases-4 and -5 are involved in IBD-associated intestinal inflammation. In addition to identifying caspases-4 and -5 as potential targets for limiting intestinal inflammation, this study has identified epithelial-expressed caspases-4 and -5 as biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential in CRC. However, the involvement of two related inflammatory caspase members, caspases-4 and -5, during intestinal homeostasis and disease has not yet been established. "

Treatment with antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibits chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium. The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin. cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. In an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of Escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety.

Dominant mutations in GARS, encoding the essential enzyme glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), result in a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2D (CMT2D), predominantly characterized by lower motor nerve degeneration. A novel mutation in glycyl-tRNA synthetase caused Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D with facial and respiratory muscle involvement. Comprehensive analysis of known CMT-related genes revealed a novel heterozygous c.815T\u003eA, p.L218Q mutation in glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS), a causative gene for both CMT type 2D (CMT2D) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V). Dominant mutations in GARS cause rare forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal spinal muscular atrophy. Using exome sequencing she was found to harbor compound heterozygous mutations within the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is an autosomal-dominant axonal peripheral neuropathy characterized by impaired motor and sensory function in the distal extremities. mutations of human GlyRS (hGlyRS) were also found to be associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. After a diagnosis of CMT type 2, the symptoms progressed, and in her fourth decade, facial and respiratory muscle weakness appeared, ultimately requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Distal weakness appeared in childhood and became worse with age. "

Human heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal erythrocytes are known to detect the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Human muscle from normal (no evident disease, n \u003d 3), Becker (BMD, n \u003d 3) and Duchenne (DMD, n \u003d 3) muscular dystrophy individuals had absent to very low Neu5Gc staining, but some punctate intracellular muscle staining was present in BMD and DMD muscles. Human polyclonal IgG antibodies directly against the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are potential biomarkers and mechanistic contributors to cancer and other diseases associated with chronic inflammation. These antibodies likely play a role in several inflammation-mediated pathologies including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Losing this sugar changed how humans interact with some of our deadliest pathogens: malaria, influenza, and streptococcus among others. A concern recently has been raised that human embryonic stem cell (HESC) lines cultured with currently available methods may have limited clinical usefulness due to the immunogenicity of the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc incorporated into their membranes during culturing. Nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc is very low in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors differentiated with B27/N2 and noggin. "

Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. Using homozygosity mapping in the family and exome sequencing in two affected individuals we identified a novel protein-truncating mutation in the C12orf65 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in mitochondrial translation. Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that gasdermins are expressed specifically in cells at advanced stages of differentiation in the upper epidermis, the differentiating inner root sheath and hair shaft and in the most mature sebocytes of the sebaceous gland and preputial, meibomium, ceruminous gland, and anal glands. Members of the novel gene family Gasdermin (Gsdm) are exclusively expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner in the epithelium of skin and the gastrointestinal tract. Gasdermin (GSDM or GSDMA), expressed in the upper gastrointestinal tract but frequently silenced in gastric cancers (GCs), regulates apoptosis of the gastric epithelium. These results indicate that the mouse Gsdma and Gsdma3 genes share common function to regulate epithelial maintenance. This expression pattern suggests a role for gasdermins in differentiation of the epidermis and its appendages. "

The practice of \"liquid biopsy\" as a diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic tool in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is an appealing approach, at least in theory, since it is noninvasive and easily repeated. Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform. Here we introduce cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA. Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq. We envision that CAPP-Seq could be routinely applied clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies, thus facilitating personalized cancer therapy. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Synthesis of a new Ni-phenanthroline complex and its application as an electrochemical probe for detection of nucleic acid. A new DNA sensor using a nickel(II) phenanthroline complex ([Ni(phen)(2)PHPIP]·2ClO(4)) as the electrochemical probe was developed. existing methods for ctDNA detection are restricted to genetic mutations.

Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription. 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase.

Fibronectin levels in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, or myasthenia gravis were comparable to control levels. There was a significant increase in fibronectin levels in DMD patients compared to age-matched controls. Progressive elevation in fibronectin levels was observed in longitudinal samples from 22 DMD patients followed up for a period of 6 months up to 4 years. This study suggests that serum fibronectin levels may constitute a promising biomarker to monitor disease progression in DMD patients. "

      "ideal_answer": "RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. . Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3\u0027-end. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5\u0027 end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. "

      "ideal_answer": "Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent degradation of Dnmt1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing catalytic site mutant (cys-ser), confirming that the covalent bond formation between Dnmt1 and decitabine-incorporated DNA is not essential for this process. NMT1o, the oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the N-terminal 118-amino acid domain, did not undergo decitabine-mediated degradation, which further proves the requirement of multiple domains including nuclear localization signa. These studies provide substantial evidence that decitabine-induced degradation of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 does not require covalent bond formation with the substrate and also elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Analysis of glycerol density gradient fractions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei showed that both nucleosomal and nucleoplasmic DNMT1 are degraded upon decitabine treatment. The maximal effect caused by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) persuaded us to investigate further its role in decitabine-mediated DNMT1 degradation. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. Recent studies indicating that decitabine also induces regional chromatin remodeling of some unmethylated genes suggest additional mechanisms of action. "

Modulation of p53 and MDM2 activity by novel interaction with Ras-GAP binding proteins (G3BP). we have found that members of the Ras network of proteins, Ras-GTPase activating protein-SH3-domain-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and 2), bind to p53 in vitro and in vivo. Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) was one gene that was significantly influenced by G3BP1 depletion which led to a 2-3 fold increased expression. Our data show that expression of G3BPs leads to the redistribution of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The G3BP2 isoform additionally associated with murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53. G3BP2 expression resulted in significant reduction in MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and degradation. Depletion of PMP22 resulted in increased proliferation and the G3BP1-mediated effect on proliferation was not seen upon PMP22-depletion. We examined three conserved host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 in dengue virus (DENV-2) infection and found them to be novel regulators of the interferon (IFN) response against DENV-2.

In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determined. Reduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (\u003c10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transporters. Glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) are the most abundant subtypes and are essential for the functioning of the mammalian CNS, but the contribution of the EAAC1 subtype in the clearance of synaptic glutamate has remained controversial, because the density of this transporter in different tissues has not been determined. In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral.

N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is an immunogenic sugar of dietary origin that metabolically incorporates into diverse native glycoconjugates in humans. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a sialic acid synthesized by animals, but not by humans or birds. Human heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal erythrocytes are known to detect the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). As dietary Neu5Gc is primarily found in red meat and milk products, we suggest that this ongoing antigen-antibody reaction may generate chronic inflammation, possibly contributing to the high frequency of diet-related carcinomas and other diseases in humans. Because anti-Neu5Gc Abs can promote chronic inflammation, the long-term safety of living and acellular pig tissue implants in recipients warrants further evaluation. These data suggest that anti-Neu5Gc Abs represent a barrier for long-term acceptance of porcine xenografts. the human anti-Neu5Gc antibody response is diverse and polyclonal. However, it can be incorporated in human cells and can trigger immune response. "

Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. One potentially interesting class of antimicrobials are the modified bacteriocins termed lantibiotics, which are bacterially produced, posttranslationally modified, lanthionine/methyllanthionine-containing peptides. Mechanisms that hinder the action of lantibiotics are often innate systems that react to the presence of any cationic peptides/proteins or ones which result from cell well damage, rather than being lantibiotic specific. Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Lantibiotics are biologically active peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria. "

Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes. "

      "ideal_answer": "Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are Pax7(+) myogenic stem cells that reside between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofiber. Skeletal muscle repair is facilitated by a population of dedicated muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, that reside in anatomically defined niches within muscle tissues. Skeletal muscle mass, function, and repair capacity all progressively decline with aging, restricting mobility, voluntary function, and quality of life. Satellite cells are multipotential stem cells that mediate postnatal muscle growth and respond differently to temperature based upon aerobic versus anaerobic fiber-type origin. Depending on the magnitude of tissue trauma, SCs may divide minimally to repair subtle damage within individual myofibers or produce a larger progeny pool that forms new myofibers in cases of overt muscle injury. In adult tissues, MuSCs are retained in a quiescent state until they are primed to regenerate damaged muscle through cycles of self-renewal divisions. In mature muscles, SCs are typically quiescent, but can be activated in response to muscle injury. Satellite cells (SC) are quiescent adult muscle stem cells critical for postnatal development. "

Giant Axonal Neuropathy is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene on chromosome 16q24.1. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the GAN gene. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene resulting in a loss of a ubiquitously expressed protein, gigaxonin. The disease is progressive, with onset around age 3 years and death by the third decade of life. It is best known for the \"giant\" axons caused by accumulations of intermediate filaments. GAN results from recessive mutations in the GAN gene encoding gigaxonin. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disease. "

The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson\u0027s disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer\u0027s disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Hypocretin levels 6 months after TBI were significantly lower in patients with post-traumatic EDS. These results suggest that sleep-wake disturbances, particularly EDS, fatigue and hypersomnia are common after TBI, and significantly impair quality of life. In acute TBI, we recently found decreased CSF levels of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter. When sleepiness is excessive, undesirable, inappropriate or unexplained, it often indicates a clinical disorder that is generically termed hypersomnia. Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea. We report on an 83 yr old man with hypersomnia and central sleep apnoea (CSA). "

Incontinentia Pigmenti is a rare X-linked multisystem disorder with well described and pathognomonic skin manifestations. Some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period. Several clinical presentations could be identified, comprising seizures, infantile encephalopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and ischemic stroke. Skin lesions are highly diagnostic, occurring in neonates, with a particular distribution on Blaschko lines. The hallmark of ocular IP is retinal vasculopathy including peripheral retinal vascular nonperfusion, macular infarction and neovascularization, and preretinal neovascularization. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting ectodermal tissue: skin, eyes, central nervous system, hair, nails, and teeth. CNS involvement consists of seizures, mental retardation, hemiparesis, spasticity, microcephaly, cerebellar ataxia, and coma. Neurological manifestations are found in 30% of IP patients, forming one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality of the condition. The involved gene is NEMO, an essential component of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder resulting from a mutation of IKBKG.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by proximal limb muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased deep-tendon reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. A significant proportion of patients also have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. Nearly 50-60% of patients with LEMS have an underlying tumour that, in almost all cases, is a small-cell lung cancer;. LEMS weakness typically involves lower and upper limbs and the proximal muscles are predominantly affected. LEMS recognition is based on clinical, electrophysiological and immunological criteria. More than half of the affected patients have associated small cell lung cancer. "

Cytoplasmic dynein-2 is the motor for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT), and mutations in dynein-2 are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies. All six IFT-A components and their motor protein, DYNC2H1, have been linked to human skeletal ciliopathies, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD; also known as Jeune syndrome), Sensenbrenner syndrome, and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). The IFT dynein-2 motor complex that regulates ciliary retrograde protein transport contains a heavy chain dynein ATPase/motor subunit, DYNC2H1, along with other less well functionally defined subunits. Bidirectional (anterograde and retrograde) motor-based intraflagellar transport (IFT) governs cargo transport and delivery processes that are essential for primary cilia growth and maintenance and for hedgehog signaling functions. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) depends on two evolutionarily conserved modules, subcomplexes A (IFT-A) and B (IFT-B), to drive ciliary assembly and maintenance. Deficiency of IFT proteins, including DYNC2H1, underlies a spectrum of skeletal ciliopathies. "

Lesch-Nyhan disease and its attenuated variants are caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine recycling enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) is the result of mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the purine metabolic enzyme, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). Since LND is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme HPRT, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) that carry this mutation are a precious source for delineating the consequences of HPRT deficiency and for developing new treatments. The study of Lesch-Nyhan-diseased (LND) human brain is crucial for understanding how mutant hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) might lead to neuronal dysfunction. Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). We describe a family of seven boys affected by Lesch-Nyhan disease with various phenotypes.

Certain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism. Seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism. Some 40% of the group showed all or many of the symptoms typical of autistic disorder. Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. "
